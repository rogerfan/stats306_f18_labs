Comment: They are not to quick actually. It's mainly the Fentanyl market that's ruining it for the rest of us! But 3f-pvp will probably get banned in 6-10 months, because it's going to be very popular and the goverment hates fun so.

Comment: Autism is a high honor in the tech savvy mischievous meme addicted community. Autism isn't a pejorative but a badge of honor and understanding. Anon always aspires to be autistic and not be complacent with globalist shill tendies. To be autistic is to be part of keks army and to feed off of meme magick. Meme magick surrounds us all. Normies try to control memes and enforce their societal norms on it. This angers kek for kek gave us the gift of meme magick to shape the world. When a bunch of autists come together and harness the memes they can do anything. When a normie hears Hillary Clinton talk about the dangers of a cartoon frog, she is discredited. But we know, we plan, we meme.

But nowadays I leave auto invest off so I can decide when to buy or not. Its best to reinvest when the price of Bitcoin is peaking vs dipping so you can "get more bang for your buck".

Bad set of algos for the version of gpg available at the time, bad set of default attributes for the version available at the time, no direct association of the key with satoshi.  What you‚Äôre supposed to believe is that on the day when satoshi generates the widely known key using all the default params of gpg available at the time, he also used command line client to generate another key with specific parameters that would suddenly be chosen as defaults in future versions.  There is no plausible explanation for this other than Craig faked the proof. He is a con artist.

I just saw the types of packaging suggesting ingredient and such, rather than prepackaged snacks.   Where I'm from in the US, the only 24 hour stores are convenience stores with junk foods and soda. You're lucky if you can find milk or any produce at all.  As someone who is a night owl and works long hours, I'd really appreciate a full grocery store that is 24 hours. I've literally never seen a 24 hour fully featured grocery store in my life.

This will infuriate and offend the developer who will just move on to the next project. Then 6 months later there will be a patch where they will add p2w micro transactions to the game.

Comment: I get that you're upset by it, but like you said, this thread is supposedly not about that game but just a general question about rules vs. story. The issue isn't really about whether or not the DC should have been so high or whether or not your DM should have put you in that position. The issue is about whether a character should get a lower spell save DC because of their background. And my answer is no. I don't think you should get special treatment because of your backstory.  I get that this upsets you, but continuing to make threads about it isn't going to make people suddenly validate your position or feeling that you shouldn't have been affected. Should your DM have done that? Who knows. I have no idea what's going on in your game because I wasn't there. But it's clear that it upset you, so just talk to your DM about it and/or leave the game.

Comment: &gt;They had their lares, the vestal virgins, the pontifex maximus and on and on.  And the President throws a Christmas party every year, Bernie Sanders had to dance around being an atheist. The Romans had a state religion which was practical for organizing the masses, but the elite didn't care that much or believe in it any more than they believe in congressional decorum today.  As for whether people cared about auguries  &gt;Caesar's very first enactment after becoming consul was, that the proceedings both of the senate and of the people should day by day be compiled and published. He also revived a by-gone custom, that during the months when he did not have the fasces an orderly should walk before him, while the lictors followed him. He brought forward an agrarian law too, and **when his colleague announced adverse omens, he resorted to arms and drove him from the Forum**; and when next day Bibulus made complaint in the senate and no one could be found who ventured to make a motion, or even to express an opinion about so high-handed a proceeding (although decrees had often been passed touching less serious breaches of the peace), Caesar's conduct drove him to such a pitch of desperation, that from that time until the end of his term he did not leave his house, but **merely issued proclamations announcing adverse omens**  Roman auguries were the CBO scores of the Roman state. Our forecasts have gotten more evidence-based, but at the end of the day the elite dgaf what they say unless they agree with them.

Cost of living is higher than home, but there are so many more opportunities here and it was the smartest long term decision if I want to get ahead in my career.  However, work in my field isn't steady and doesn't pay well at entry level. I do have two other jobs, but still can't afford to go back home- it's not the money to travel that would hit me, but the time I'd need to take off work.

Comment: Well, yeah, because gizmos are static. And are remnant of the first or second episode, where he highlights the general idea. If you copy the whole collision detection logic into gizmos function, you'll get a more accurate representation which you can view in realtime (when you play the game and keep the editor window visible).  Yeah, the speed ends up getting multiplied by time.deltatime so you end up with a way smaller value "in action".  And, if you're using a collider that is not box collider (assuming by your image), than this approach might not be the best possible for you. You could technically do the same with box collider too, but things will get too complicated too fast, since you'll move diagonally in countless different angles, so you'll end up having to calculate the precise angle using x and y velocity vectors on each frame, and being a bad mathematician, I have no idea how would you go about determining the length of the rays in that way. But, it seems to me that in doing so, you'll still probably have the core logic from this tutorial.  But, bottom line is, just test it out and see what works best for you and what are the specific problems you might encounter.

Comment: &gt; How often did you try?  This was the main way I filled out my tree, up until every item was level 4 or higher. At that point I switched to crafting random level 5 items, and when I couldn't rely on them not being duplicates, I started specifying level and slot.  Haven't done the maths on it, but I decided to stop the random crafting when I found an item that had to be instantly reclaimed for a much lower cost than I paid. That's not a good deal for me, I'd rather wait a little longer and get the right one.

I‚Äôd suggest getting a can of Miller and some good quality (not clear) apple juice.  Start with more juice than beer, then increase the beer to see how much you really like,    Or maybe you won‚Äôt like it at all‚Äîbut you‚Äôre only out a buck-79 for a big can of Miller High Life, so hey, it‚Äôs s low-risk proposition.    Note:  There are hundreds of beers out there and I‚Äôll probably be laughed off the sub for drinking Miller.  But I like it, and that‚Äôs good enough for me.  Have fun.

Comment: Also, if cap doesn‚Äôt work there are two reasons you can check. One is to select the new poly surface and use show edges which will highlight if any of the points you swept are unconnected and there‚Äôs now a gap on one of the edges of the sweep. The other is if the original polyline wasn‚Äôt in a perfect place. Easy solution is to extend the sweep past 180 degrees, then extrude a new plane vertically and trim to that so you know the edges are perfectly flat.

So the next part of the question is can you get a clear video chat from an Echo Show to another Echo show on the same wifi network if the internet connection to the outside is not fast enough for clear video (say, 512kbps)?    In other words, does the video (and audio for audio calls) all go to an Amazon server before another Echo device, or is the Amazon servers just used for identifying users and establishing the connection, but the high bandwidth video just stays in the internal network?

Comment: A more interesting (imo) example comes from Portuguese, where feminine nouns are sometimes used as augmentatives/something close to that.  *o saco* - sack (supermarket/lunch size) *o manto* - cloak   *a saca* - sack (transport for agriculture size) *a manta* - blanket  Though I don't think what happens in Romance languages is what the OP¬†is asking; not everything in Romance languages has a gender based minimal pairs (definitely not the majority), and when it happens, the difference in meaning is completely arbitrary. Having a gender system like that requires a minimum of consistency, even if just as a fallback when a new word pops up, as in "oh no, we loaned the masculine "toi" (toy) from English, what will the feminine mean?".

Comment: &gt; This was a poor strategic move on Guatemala's part.   Not really much of an option given the US's history of bullying and blackmailing other countries into doing its bidding.   Would not be surprised at all if many countries were told by the Trump administration that their vote on Jerusalem will show if they are "with us or against us".   Being a bully has pretty much been US foreign policy for several decades now.

Unless someone just wants to don the mask to see this priest for themselves, or for the tusks on the mask, it‚Äôs not that much of a prize. However, the grind of getting all the masks is more than worth it and is something I do on every play through.

Comment: The seeds will not come true. Apples don't come true from seed, but instead roll the genetic dice with every seedling.   You need to graft from this tree onto a different rootstock. Talk to the extension office about how to do this, they will have information and experts to help you.  http://msue.anr.msu.edu/county  Your Tax Dollars At Work.  Apple trees can live 200 years, so it's possible that all yours needs is some judicious and knowledgeable pruning to rejuvenate it. This would be something for an expert, not something you're going to do after reading a few internet articles.

I‚Äôm fine with ‚Äúguessing‚Äù about what a work means if there is no evidence of the intended meaning, but I just don‚Äôt like disregarding what an author explicitly says.  To me, it would be like me writing this comment and someone saying it meant that I hated you. I never meant that, so why would that be what my comment meant? It just irks me.  But, if someone enjoys a piece more because they say it means something, then whatever. Have at it.

If you starve you should go and find work and not starve anymore.   In communism the State controls everything and takes your food away so it can sell it.  That means it's the direct fault of the state for people starving.

Literally, all he did was have a giant drama hologram and get stabbed like five minutes after he showed up in person.  But hey, continue to read way too much into what you see with absolutely zero sense of nuance or irony.

Comment: Gamergate had nothing to do with sexism though. They simply petitioned the FTC for better ethical standards and won those standards. Anyone can look up the changes Gamergate petitioned for on the FTC website. I mean, they're right there.  The whole "Gamers are sexist" thing was a narrative. A long debunked one at this point.  Gaming journalists were forced to update their ethical policies thanks to GG after the FTC made the changes.

All you need is an [air chisel,](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-Air-Hammer-with-Chisels/3309276) a compressor, respirator and safety glasses, and time. When you are done you need to seal the brick and mortar with a masonry sealer.

Comment: It's the best time of the year to smoke imho. The cold allows you to smoke slower and longer. It's the only time of year we'll cold smoke fish, never letting the temp's get over 90f. Smoking in the summer just isn't the same.  Also, check out Goody Cole's down in southern NH sometime when you're passing through. Best smoked meats I've ever had in New England... sauce is served on the side, because it's an actual smoke house, not some grilled meat ketchup shop.

By no means would I put every single egg in that one (albeit diversified) basket.   I‚Äôll consider buying more when Warren passes away if it takes a hit. With that being said, Warren himself says a low cost S&amp;P index fund is the way to go.

Comment: I don't intend to imply that I have come across some understanding yet to be conceptualized, and I tried to make that rather clear by saying just that. Nonetheless, I will concede that, given sufficient conversation, you and I could seemingly come to a point of complete agreement, and likely in compatibilism. However, I am saying that you probably won't want to discuss this further simply to convince one person that compatibilism is correct, or accurate.

Comment: I don't know what he thinks of the is - ought fallacy specifically but he did claim that scientific truth explains **all** other truths, which isn't right because of the is - ought fallacy. Maybe he was thinking of just descriptive propositions and not normative when he said that. But when JBP brought up the example of the KGB experimenting with viruses he sidestepped the issue all together. He said the fact that it is unethical doesn't undermine the "truthiness" of it, which is the same thing SH said. But if both of them accept there is something called as moral truth, then they have to accept JBP's account (*truth includes both "is" and "ought"*), which is that at a micro or scientific level it can be true but not at the macro or pragmatic level. . As for your other question of how metaphorical truth bootstraps it self I think that is what embodied cognition is about; that pdf link I shared links the ideas of evolution, pragmatism and language in a really nice way.

Any less and all it does is help stack a tac or tickle and distract an npc.  For pvp?  Forget about it.

Comment: First and foremost you should figure out what your investment goals are. Outside of your retirement funds you still need goals or at least a plan.   Otherwise your like a boat with no destination, just drifting lost out at sea.   Then find a few books and read up on that type of investing.

Comment: Daredevil was far superior, Jessica Jones falls apart completely on a second viewing. Actually it barely holds up on its first viewing, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the show but it wasted literally the entire season on a plot line that went nowhere and accomplished nothing. Only like the last 2 or 3 episodes manage to move the story forward in any meaningful way.  I've re-watched Daredevil 6 times and love it from beginning to end every time, with Jessica Jones I was bored to tears 20 mins into a second viewing because I knew it wasn't gonna get to the point for another 10 hours.

Comment: Not a bad looking collection!  First glance doesn't show the most obvious signs of fakes, but there are some good fakes out there.  The one on the bottom right with the bamboo-style handle and spout isn't a common style to fake, but the pattern of darkening suggests this is either well-seasoned or, more likely, enhanced to look aged with "shoe polishing" (either with a wash of darkened clay, or even something akin to a shoe polish).  If the inside isn't equally seasoned then it's likely artificially mimicing age.

Absolutely not, mmo teams are huge and they need to be paid. I don't think you realize how much money goes into these games.

Comment: As stated, I'm a fan of the Tubes but I wanted something "next level" in that department.    Feels well made yet feather light.  Didn't know it had a clip, that was a pleasant surprise.  It's snap-on plastic which would seem cheap but apparently it's quality plastic.  Bows out quite a way, snaps back into shape and the side clips don't budge.  We'll see how it does clipped to my bag.  I hate fiddling with various modes.  This has a one-button push for moonlight and turbo, my most used modes.  Turbo ramps down to high after a bit and will put your eye out.  Also, like the price.  Seems a lot of bag for your buck.

There are no typos anywhere also, the off is centered, but the sleeve ends dont wrap around your hand but kinda hang out like long sleeved shirt, and that's what im mostly worried about. Idk if its intended as I've never worn any other off white hoodie before.

I'll see if I can extract the seed with seed pitter later, although unfortunately I dont remember the map settings...   The key was actually kumasi, not petra, because that meant 100s of culture per turn, lots of envoys, and then globalization with the science scaling civic for more than 1000 science per turn.  I didnt even find this spot until halfway through the game, and needed to raze an ai petra to be able to build it here.  And yeah, civ on a big screen looks nice :). Now if only the game Ai wasnt so slow!

Comment: &gt; If a home owner asks me if his electrical panel can shock him, would it make sense for me to tell him "not if there's no power coming from the primaries!" "not If the transformer outside your house is not working!"? I personally would take the context she's asking the question in and say "yes it can".   Well, you can tell the homeowner what ever you want.  You asked a specific question about thermal imaging, and I tried to explain it to you like an electrician would to another electrician, not a homeowner.  &gt;Without a load, taking an image of that connection is no different than taking a picture of some romex laying on the ground.  Take a minute and re-read what I said here.  Let it soak in.  You seem to mistakenly think that old houses have high loads on them at all times.  Sometimes they do, like during dinner prep time or winter heating season, sometimes they don't, like when everyone is away at work and school.  Like I explained three posts ago, *you need to turn everything on to take an accurate image*, it doesn't matter if you have the $100 dongle or a $100,000 water-cooled camera.   Honestly, the majority of the issues I've seen with the thermal camera I have already noticed with just a visual inspection.  You can see when wires have been hot even if they're not hot now.  Sometimes just feeling the breakers will alert you to an issue, but sometimes that "issue" is normal loading of a breaker and not indicative of a problem.  Buy the dongle, use it as much as you want, get as much training as you can, *but it won't take the place of skilled troubleshooting!*

Comment: There is a lot more volume in the high dimensional spaces that encode our datasets than there are points in our datasets. As a corollary, there is a lot more variance in a random sample of the spaces that we use to encode data than there is variance in our data sets.  So our data lives in a subset of the encoding space. And that subset isn't a random sampling of the space, it has geometric or, at least, topological structure. This can be modeled as a (topological) manifold. So in a reasonably precise mathematical sense our datasets live on a manifold embedded in the encoding space. The geometric and/or topological structure of that manifold is what people are referencing when they say "pattern" in the context of data.  Now let's look at a simple example of embedding a manifold. If you take the 2D euclidean plane and bend or stretch it without cutting or pinching it then it retains the same topological structure: locally euclidean. When this underlying topological structure is encoded in 2D real vectors then the topological nearness of points in the space can be measured accurately with the dot product. But if we were to bend up the plane and embed it in 3D space then we could no longer use the dot product alone to determine topological nearness, even if it was a very simple and homogenous embedding like a parabloid. But we can maybe find a function that transforms the data encoding in such a way that the dot-product can measure nearness in the resulting space.  tl;dr: One of the things RBMs do is help transform the encoding space so that the structure of the underlying data manifold is coded in the dot products of the transformed representations.  Edit: The above is a simplification to help to help you begin understanding the question. The full answer is not yet known to humanity.

Comment: &gt; we only get to see the most common, conventional, and benign uses of the feature  One of the most important uses of TH is to create DSLs that are integrated into systems built in Haskell. That is the principal documented purpose of quasiquoters, and one of the major uses of TH throughout the ecosystem.  As correctly discussed near the beginning of the tutorial, there are reasons why this use of TH, like others, may be more appropriate  or less appropriate for particular use cases.  There are whole ecosystems, such as Yesod, which make extensive use of TH DSLs, and could never have existed without them. The Yesod platform is used widely in large commercial systems and has attracted hundreds of developers to Haskell.  EDIT: Removed phrase that came out sounding negative about this tutorial. It was unintended - it's a great tutorial. Sorry.

Comment: I agree after a certain point, but it depends on how you do it. I think that having all 5 P5 champs, 1 G5 team and 2 At-large bids, produces the best results.  1. Every conference is represented, which means that every area of the country is involved.  2. It removes the ability for a G5 team (or any team for that matter) to go undefeated yet miss the playoffs.  3. It means that every team can control their own destiny, if you win the conference you are in. If not then you can't really complain when you get left out for someone else.   4. 2 at large bids is plenty to ensure that we don't have a situation like 2011 where some people argued that Bama shouldn't have been in because they didn't win the conference just because they played the best team in the country prior.   5. You can't really compare an 8 team playoff to the bracket. The bracket is an extreme, but that is also the point. Adding 4 teams is not going to turn the season into the bracket.  6. What does "deserving" mean? If you win your conference you should have a shot. Just because you lost a game or 2 doesn't mean that you might not be the best team in the country. Additionally you have to take into account the fact that you will have to win 3 games to win the championship. If the 8 seed comes in and is a sketchy P5 team who has 2 losses but won their conference, or a G5 team that is undefeated, and they have a win over the #1 team, #3 team, and #2 team going into the playoffs in 3 consecutive games, is their resume not "deserving" enough? Likewise, if the #1 team can't beat the #8 seed before playing in the second game, then they are probably not deserving. Adding an extra game doesn't make this become a crapfest, you would still have a lot of very good teams. This year you would have    Clemson - Wisconsin  Oklahoma - Alabama   Georgia - UCF  Ohio St. - USC  Where the rankings are based on Top 5 P5 Champs+G5 Champ ranked, then at large bids ranked.

It's like the hot stove theory, touching it is hot and my brain doesn't want to touch that code again.  Identifying this is half the battle though, digging in and implementing is what we have to do to learn, we learn by doing and doing through practice.

Comment: I like both and both have their place. I usually see my partners about once a week, anything on top of that is bonus time and may include double dates, casual group hangouts or parties. Works out to about 80/20 in favor of one-on-one. If we lived closer, the ratio might change, but I'd want at least 1 solo date per week!   There may be other folks on this sub who either cohabitate or live closer, so there should be variety in the responses. The important thing is getting enough time for each relationship, however much that is!

Comment: I liked the movie a lot.  I think the complaints fall into three broad categories.  Cat 1)  there is a somewhat subpar sideplot that drags the pacing of the movie.  This is a legit complaint.  Cat 2)  Some fans had preconceived notions of what was going to happen, were wrong, and are now cranky about.  Not a legit complaint.  Cat 3)  People who take Star Wars WAY to seriously and are nitpicking stuff that only a maniac level fan would complain about.  I'm a big fan of SW, but some of these people are just absurd.  Not a legit complaint.  Overall I think the critics got it right, not a perfect movie, but a good, entertaining movie.

Comment: one way to check if changes you have made have speed up a loop is to each loop(or every few loops) get the time elapsed and print that and check the time before you made changes and the time after you have made the changes.  i have 2 methouds i use for this one is to get the time before the loop and after while conunting the number of times the loop ran and as stuch get an average time for each pass of the loop or i call something a deltaTime function in the loop and use that instead          //after loop evaluation     SET oldTime TO TIME:SECONDS.     SET loopCycle TO 0.     UNTIL someLoopCheckHere {     	//do core loop stuff here     	SET loopCycle TO loopCycle + 1.     }     PRINT "averaged time per loop cycle is: " + ROUND((TIME:SECONDS - oldTime) / loopCycle,2) + "s".      //deltaTime function in loop call     UNTIL someLoopCheckHere {     	//do core loop stuff here     	PRINT "time elapsed: " + delta_time().     }          FUNCTION delta_time {     	IF NOT (DEFINED prevousTime) { GLOBAL prevousTime IS TIME:SECONDS. }     	LOCAL deltaTime IS TIME:SECONDS - prevousTime.     	SET prevousTime TO TIME:SECONDS.     	RETURN deltaTime.     }  There are other things that you can take advantage of like for updating the terminal how fast do you really need to be updated and slowing that down will speed up the rest of the script like:      IF screenCounter &gt; 10 { print "stuff". SET screenCounter TO 0. } ELSE { SET screenCounter TO screenCounter + 1. }     //note this assumes you are printing a lot of lines not just the one in the example     //also works to save some CPU cycles if you don't need to do some math/function every time though the loop  Also for IF statement if you have more than one condition like IF a &gt; b AND b &lt; c { do stuff } kOS does have what is called shortcircurting where as soon kOS sees it is impossible for the if to be true it will not even bother checking the other conditions on the if so have the conditions that are most likely to be false first so you don't spend unneeded CPU time evaluating the if.  Another way to save cycles is to pre compute at much as you can most notably if a bit is math you are using has something like constant * constant then you can pre compute that and store the value so you don't need to compute it every time through the loop example being the Ideal Rocket Equation: Dv = ISP * G * log(wetMass / dryMass) for most cases of use ISP and G are not changing so you only need to calculate them once.  The exceptions are in a atmosphere or a staging event and then the ISP * G needs to be recalculated as ISP is likely changing constantly in the atmosphere or you are now using different engines and thus have different ISP in the case of the state.  And the last general thing I can think of is to try and avoid WHEN THEN unless absolutely needed as they get evaluated every physics tick and as such can end up taking a lot of CPU time any other advice would need code and runtests

We spoke to Cardi B driectly about it &amp; she confirms it‚Äôs him. Cardi tells FAMEOLOUS the hackers released videos of her as well, and she claims the hackers are sending her messages daily. Offset‚Äôs outfit and shoes gave him away. The rapper wore the same pants this year in September and Cardi also confirmed that it was in September. Cardi tells us that‚Äôs she sad about it and want to be left alone at the moment. The tea comes days after Cardi bought Offset a $400k car.

Comment: I'd rather focus on specific markets and industries, than the broad economy. Neither type of economic policy works for the "entire" economy.  &gt; Supply side is good for a weak economy in the short term to provide an immediate boost.  The same is true for demand side. That's their entire purpose. To stimulate the market to do something besides what it is currently doing.  &gt; Over the long term, especially in a healthy economy, it's not  Healthy? As in, when supply is fulfulling demand? Well yeah, then there is no point in implementing it and any measures taken are a waste.   Or how are you measuring healthy? GDP? Sum produced or purchased? Or are we looking at standard of living increases?  &gt; The economy is in great shape with tax rates already low.  Is the health care market in great shape? Is the education market in great shape? In the ISP market is great shape? The economy is multifaceted.  The problem with using a catch all term like "the economy" is that some markets can be doing well while others are doing poorly, and we can still see an increase in "growth". And then we get complacent and never end up addressing specific problems.

Your video wasn't great- it was a good effort (and I'm for real not trying to give you a participation trophy lol) but you were very off topic. It was a video to share w your bros, but as someone just starting out you need to step up your game if you want to actually be a viable youtube channel.

Comment: When I was subhonours English/Philosophy/History: 3 days out of 7 I'd be up at 9:45 for lectures, often from 11 to 1. I would either go home for lunch, or go to the library or a tutorial after that on those days, and then be back in town in the afternoon for another class. It wouldn't be unusual to have a committee meeting of some sort after the final class, then I'd go home. The other 4 days I'd be out of bed between 7am and 11:30am, either for a tutorial or some society commitment or just to work in my own time. On days I didn't have class I would work about 1pm to 7pm, and class days tended to be 11am to 7pm. The evenings after 7pm seemed to be taken up with socialising or societies of some sort more often than not before subhonours, if only for an hour or so - but my friends all lived in the same hall. I rarely took weekends off, and if I did it was just a day - the price I paid for sleeping in most days...  Society business, I'll admit, took up the majority of my studying time in the second semester of second year, which I wouldn't recommend, but I think it's done wonders for my personal growth and my CV (not my grades, mind). But I'm unusually involved frankly.  4th year English Lit: I have 4 contact hours a week. This term I did my dissertation and I was in the library 8:30am to between 6pm and 10pm each day for the last three weeks! Society business tends to take up 10 hours a week but I'm able to be flexible now, which actually makes it much easier to get through. Most days I would attend class, grab lunch, and go back home before studying for a few hours. In crunch weeks I'd have no spare time at all, even for Netflix, and occasionally nothing much would be happening. There's probably a more sustainable way to do it but that was my experience.

Again, most people don't view fetuses as human until at least three months into pregnancy, and I'm arguing that this should be kept, not that all abortions should be allowed, and I want to see if there's any reasoning that it shouldn't be allowed right after fertilization.

Comment: I have had the 500w version of your PSU in my Media/sister's PC at my mom's house for about a year and no problem. First back off your overclock and any extra voltage on your CPU because sometimes over time an overclock may go bad. Then, Try plugging it into a good surge protector and maybe try a different outlet it may be outlet related. Lastly, you may need a new PSU. I use EVGA PSUs in my rig and my lab box and they work fine. Also, I heard Seasonic, Antec, Corsair, Cooler Master, InWin, Fractal Design, Silverstone, and Enermax make decent PSUs.  It's probably is your overclock. I had that issue that you were having (except I woke up in the middle of the night with the fans spinning at max) shortly after I enabled XMP when I upgraded to my 7700k this past Spring and I had to change some settings and that fixed the issue.  With that said I don't overclock my CPUs mainly because Intel's Turbo Boost and AMD's XFR (not as much, mainly because I use stock cooling on that PC) do a decent job boosting up and I am going for the most stability (even though I will be overclocking my 7700k when it gets older).

It's not because a music is 200 years old that's it's classical music, that's like saying a 2017 painting would be described in 100 years as an impressionist painting. BTW I hope you do know composers still write classical music today, if not you're missing out ;) .

Comment: I bought the Dr. Collins PCAT study guide. The Chemistry, Math, and Reading sections were very very similar to the actual PCAT, and would recommend it in a heartbeat. However, the biology section was a bit different. I believe Kaplan‚Äôs biology section resembles the actual test a lot better. Can‚Äôt really go wrong with either of these books. You could also buy the Pearson practice tests and time yourself when doing those after you‚Äôve finished with the Kaplan/Collins book to get more practice. Some of the questions from the Pearson exams were identical to the actual exam too so that was nice   If you want more info on the Dr. Collins book their website is here: http://pcatprepclass.com

Comment: My sister made bread and some roasted potatoes to bring to our family Christmas Eve breakfast. I had the potatoes and used the bread to make "French" toast-- basically just pan fried the bread like you would a grilled cheese. Top with fruit and maple syrup and I was happy camper. I have leftovers for Christmas morning too üòç My family made fun of me for being vegan, but I just laugh it off while I eat those tasty potatoes.   Happy Holidays to everyone!

Comment: I'd also suggest there is a difference between immersion and attention, even if a vague one.   I might feel very involved and immersed at the level of attention form a game of tetris, but it doesn't invoke subjective experience of "what its like" to do something, in way that often mean when we suggest a game is "immersive."  If that makes sense.

Comment: How to find a car? I go on kijiji used car section and you can do a search based on your budget range, mileage and year range. I've found some incredible deals for older vehicles with extremely low mileage 1999 Mercury Cougar, 80,000 km $1500. The car basically sat for most of its life as the owner travelled around the world on work. It did need work as a car that age will have its own unique problems.  Budget that you will have to spend an extra $1000 to get the car up to spec. There's always something that needs fixing. Could be tires, a new windshield, battery, tune-up, etc.. Sometimes nothing, and that depends on how much your budget is.

You've gone through some really tough times together since the breakup and Rob has been a rockstar of a supportive boyfriend. And he's seen you at a really bad time and still wants to be with you. So I would vote that getting married is a great idea. Take care of each other and make your marriage a fortress that protects you from the rest of the world.

Comment: &gt; I always get the feeling that I am being used, since all I've had to do, every time, is repeat what the protagonist said, without any sort of input from me. What bothers me the most about this is that the therapist instructs the protagonist to tell me how to sit/stand, how to look, and so on  Actually, that is exactly what psychodrama is. The point is to perfectly emulate the "other person" so that the working individual can practice - in as real of a situation as possible - their reactions. If you watch videos by Moreno (the founder), he is very particular about the methods in psychodrama.  Are you given opportunities to be the protagonist? Or are you forced to be an observer or auxiliary every time?  If psychodrama is a modality that makes you uncomfortable (which is what you're expressing), then it might be better to look for another group. You might do better in a general process group where you are able to freely share your own thoughts and opinions.  &gt; But, in this case, my issue would be the fact that I wasn't informed that this was the procedure when I joined the group.  This is also just bad protocol on the part of the group leader. They should have told you what was going on in group and allowed you to ask questions about the procedure.

Comment: **Robot Operating System**  Robot Operating System (ROS) is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Running sets of ROS-based processes are represented in a graph architecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post and multiplex sensor, control, state, planning, actuator and other messages.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/robotics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

If you rent warehouse space, odds are you'll need to pay for an electrician to do the upgrades.   Then you have to pay rent on top of it.

Comment: That‚Äôs the problem. There‚Äôs warning all over any aerosol cans about not using near open flames. It was an act of stupidity. Instead of blaming the people that committed the act, the current trend it to put the blame on an object. A person made a mistake. It is unfortunate that someone got burned in the process. It‚Äôs not a matter of making silly string nonflammable. I have yet to see an aerosol can that isn‚Äôt flammable. It‚Äôs a matter of taking responsibility for ones actions. If we can‚Äôt do that then, like previously stated, we should probably ban gasoline too.

Comment: CBS needs to start playing these classics again. Why is every Christmas special made after the 70s always dropped from the yearly schedule? Rudolph, Frosty and Peanuts shouldn't be the only three played every year. And Freeform only plays the same three movies(Elf, Santa Clause and Polar Express) on repeat for the whole month of December. I remember back in the late 90s/early 2000s(when they were called Family Channel) when they played a variety of everything including the more obscure claymation specials. Someone needs to bring that back.

Comment: It's unknown exactly how the Brotherhood are fairing within NCR lands. Sometime after 2242 a war broke out between the NCR and the Brotherhood and was still active as of New Vegas in  2281. The Brotherhood had largely retreated from the surface and into their bunkers, much like the Mojave chapter. In Fallout 4 it's mentioned that the West Coast Brotherhood was actively putting down cults that worshipped Maxson, so they're stilling kicking around over there.

Comment: Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't see what the problem is. Is it that big of a deal that your friend didn't know if Walmart was open that you just ignore her?  I can understand being annoyed by a neighbor coming and knocking on your door to ask, but a long-time friend?

Comment: I bought an only ticket on the very top row (drink rail) at Rogers place figuring I'd have an awesome time drinking excessively with the other peasants and watching some ants play hockey. I ended up being next to two season ticket holders who were dressed up fancy and drinking wine? Awkward.

Comment: Live in Porto but never heard of this Douro Valley (do you mean the Douro River, or maybe Vila de Gaia?)  You'll love the city I'm sure. People are nice and it's a small and lively environment. The main attraction is the historical center and the areas around it. You can easily see everything within 2-3 days, and you can do everything by foot assuming you stop or stay around Trindade station (the main metro station).  Wine is basically as cheap as water here, and some of the most well known brands are made here in Porto. Food is also cheap, but Portugal is known for its seafood dishes.  Those last two points hold for all of Portugal, but the cuisine will differ slightly in every region. Northern Portugal is known for their 'francesinha' dish, kind of like a very meaty burger covered in cheese and a special sauce surrounded by fries. You'll find them in almost every restaurant in Porto, so make sure to give it a try.  Anyways I'm sure you'll like it. Aside from its old and preserved history and culture, Portugal also has a lot of beautiful natural scenery.

There may even be really good prices on them if some of the third party retailers (STP, etc.) try to get rid of stock to make room for the new stuff.

Comment: OP, people are overreacting big time to TLJ. Empire received the same hate, we all saw the community hate on the Prequels. The plot, acting, score, action sequences, the use of the Force, Luke's redemption arc, everything comes together to make to me the best Star Wars film ever.   As for Solo, I'm not sure if the community was going to rush out and see the film when it was announced to begin with.   To answer the question, there's no way Feige oversees that many properties. Kathy is just fine where she's at.

Comment: Well that's the issue you were in a PvE python. Thing is all the PvP ships are good for PvE. For PvP  You stick fixed rails and plasmas in PvE you stick gimballed on. If someone like that goes for you then fly at them and then past em and keep going quick as you can whilst they try and turn around. I know easier said than done but a bit of practice and you'll be fine. Is your ship fully engineered? That's usually the problem.

Comment: Man, maybe Darrington/Rockport but that is such a haul!  If you can afford around $120k, say a $1000/mo mortgage with PMI and zero down, you can move a doublewide manufactured home onto Anderson Island on a zero down USDA loan and that is as cheap and close to Seattle as it is going to get.  I know this after a year of research and heartbreak.  The mortgage lender and doublewide home manufacturers confirmed Anderson Island is the last resort for poor folk around here.  Then you have to factor in the ferry cost each month...  And the commute...  And the internet SUX out there, that is the biggest problem for people used to city life.  Hope this helps?  Call USDA next week in Olympia and start talking to them about zero down.  So many people don‚Äôt know about this and I wanna say there is even a program for nurses and teachers but I forget what it is, they will know.

A second option is the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, which you have to mix with water or preferably apple cider vinegar because it balances the pH of the clay. This is stronger and may leave your face red for a while but it's a good one.

Comment: If the game has a leaderboard, hidden mmr, or anything of the sort- devs have the tools to see who's top player.  Also, they always talk about players "becoming pirate legend"- what do you think that implies?  For a game that is supposedly going to have a fame system, I don't see the issue.  A game doesnt need to be an esport to listen solely to the top % of a community for feedback.  Average armchair developer has no real-world skills or value(hence armchair).  It's a safe approach.

Comment: MGSO is good for what it is, a one-stop modding makeover of Morrowind with quite a bit of customization, and I used it for a bit, but I ultimately decided to go with the Morrowind Pastebin guide instead.  I didn't like some of the aesthetic choices for the mods selected, and there are better options out there.  It does work, but it requires some fiddling to resolve some issues with missing textures and other issues.  The 30-minute Morrowind guide mentioned here is a good alternate and will give you less hassles than MGSO.  The only change I'd make is to replace Morrowind Watercolored with another texture replacer.  Watercolored is pretty, but if you ever decide to add other mods that have new textures (like Tamriel Rebuilt or Skyrim: Home of the Nords), the new textures will clash with the Morrowind Watercolored textures.

Comment: i think hardscape and leaf size are important factors. Seeing as your tank is small i'd go for varieties with smaller leaf size. That tree trunk is very nice but it's being overshadowed by that stem plant you've placed on it, which is throwing off the perspective. The java fern is nicely placed but i'd consider removing or repositioning the vals since they're overshadowing the fern. A tank this size should really only have one focal point which should be the tree/java fern, so try to build around that with smaller varieties as you've already started and maybe add a smaller hardscape piece on the right side and plant around that

Comment: They generally have been since about five years ago - the 2011 Hyundai Sonata is a good early example of a car that stood out and grabbed market share by doing this early.The 2013 Ford Fusion was a big deal when it was announced for its exterior styling, and the whole Mazda design language since 2013 has had this general strategy in mind. Then you have the Chevy Impala in the 2014 model year and all the Chevys down the line after that, gradually. So it's definitely been a strategy to introduce more sophisticated exterior styling to mass market cars this decade.

I mentioned it on Reddit and some lovely young thing sent me a gift certificate for $2 from Amazon because it was all she could afford. That was so sweet.   Last Christmas I was happy because I had found a lovely man who loved me and today I am ecstatic because I am married to him and my kids like him and life is good.

Comment: Most superpowers in Zenith Proper come from the stars; being born under a certain sign, constellation, zodiac etc. Humanity has a slight advantage because an ancient protobeing manually repositioned a few stars in strategic places around Earth.

Comment: We had to put our dog down last November. The veterinarian who helped us end her suffering was amazing. She worked a full day at her clinic. Then drove 45 minutes to our house to put her down in the place she was most comfortable and felt safe. She made it seem like it was no burden to her, and I truly appreciated everything she did for us and our girl Izzy.   Your wife sounds like she truly cares about each and every animal she treats, or has to help pass on. As an obsessive pet owner, I just want her to know that I truly appreciate how big her heart is.

Comment: USPS does Sunday and Holiday delivery for an extra $5ish (on top of the Express shipping price, it's a box you can check and so is AM delivery time, also an extra $5ish). Additionally Priority Express, unlike plain old Priority, is supposed to have a guaranteed delivery day, if that day is Saturday (or the day before a holiday) and it is somehow missed they are supposed to upgrade it to Sunday (or Holiday) delivery for free and deliver the next day and also the shipper is supposed to get the postage cost refunded since it's a guaranteed delivery date. So if it was Priority Express and not regular Priority then this option is available 365 days a year as FedEx/UPS offer similar options and to be competitive USPS needs a guaranteed overnight service for important parcels - this is it.

Comment: This is because of bns buddy update. Due to logging in from a ‚Äònew‚Äô address/machine. Past bns buddy updates have removed my authentication before and client won‚Äôt let you log in.    My fix: -close and relaunch -log in to bns website from computer/IP you are going to play the game on -you will have to reimput the account info (my saved email and password in bns buddy client was deleted after update) -should work normally.

Comment: https://i.imgur.com/u9RPejG.png  For anyone wondering what happened. Looks like birdie landed, did a cr.jab (?) and extended his hurt box into Ryu's overhead. As for the cross up message, who knows how the game detects cross ups? Maybe timing since side's were changed? Maybe comparing both characters direction when hit?

Comment: You can do it, but it is tougher to handle as a player since D&amp;D has pretty strong niche protection and you won‚Äôt have the benefits of teamwork, and as a DM you have to remember that certain encounters are going to be a lot tougher than the numbers indicate.  The best solution I‚Äôve seen for two-person play is a game called [Scarlet Heros](http://www.rpgnow.com/m/product/127458) which has its roots in an older edition of D&amp;D.  You could check at a local gaming store to see if they do Adventurer‚Äôs League.  And on the off chance that you‚Äôre in Pittsburgh, I run regularly if you want to get an idea of what it‚Äôs like.

Comment: Binance coin = all things Binance. You are investing in Binance the company which plans to do many things in the future such as a decentralized exchange. Right now the main reason to use it is because they incentivize you to by giving you 50% lower fees if you hold BNB (for the fee to be paid in). They are trying to establish BNB as Binance's own currency. It's really interesting and I like it. I enjoy being able to invest in the exchange I use.

Comment: I gotta admit that I don't know much about Paul Ricard, but this looks like it's an old photo as in 2010, they extended the pitlane (in the process closing off the road that formed the club circuit) and added chicanes to turn one. They have definitely built grandstands around the circuit since then - this looks like it was taken while it was still only a test track.  edit: apparently the chicanes at turn 1 were added in 2005, so it is even older than I thought. It was definitely a test-only track at the time.

It's absolutely interesting. Finding out that there are no magoc answers in her parentage, that she has to forge her own path isn't interesting? It's much more interesting than her being from some famous family.

It was around 3pm, a fair ways north of the arctic circle, so the sun had set this time of year, but the sky remained a vibrant red/pink/orange where the clouds were thinner.  I don't dare add more sharpening/clarity because this is a 64mp image (4x 36mp images stitched together in a panorama), so it is PLENTY sharp already, but resizing and uploading to web does lose out on the details.

Comment: Well, Rome fell from within, partly because it had overextended itself. The Eastern and Western empires had been ruled independently for a couple of hundred years by the time Rome was sacked, and they had been growing apart, and differentiated, for a long time.   I think it‚Äôs safe to say Byzantium was created before 476, maybe around the time Constantinople was made a capitol, but Rome still dominated Europe until 476.

Comment: The problem with buying and holding bitcoin is it's pure speculation. Unlike a commodity, it doesn't have any intrinsic value. Unlike fiat money, there's no government to say it's legal tender. Because of all the excitement around it, the price is being inflated by people hoping to make a quick buck.  If something big like a ban happens, or if people just lose interest, the price will collapse and a lot of people will lose money. Making the big bucks involves making decisions based on things like new technology, supply and demand, etc.  You don't get to do that when speculating on bitcoin because there's no data to back up your convictions. It's gambling plain and simple.

The closest would be the Scene program (where you can learn points from watching movies or getting the debit/credit card to help accelerate the accumulation of points). You can go on Tuesday to Cineplex locations to get roughly half off movie prices or you can purchase CNOs (Cineplex Night Outs - You can accumulate points with the basic Scene card with these) coupons which are roughly $9 at your student centre if you're attending university/college, COSTCO or CAA.

Comment: Right, unless you sell at a lower price you're guaranteed your return.  As far as selling at a lower price, you can do so if you think it'll be beneficial.  For instance, if you sell your 2 year, 5% bond after 1 year at 2% then buy a 2 year bond at 10%, you'll still be coming out ahead.  On the flip side, if you can buy a 5% bond after 1 year at 2% and are paid out 5% the next year, you've maid money because you've only waited 1 year for a 3% payout instead of the average 2.5% for the 1 year of that 2 year 5% bond.

Same with the globe and logo on the center plate of the tag title.   However, this is better than anything I can do with a custom championship so I'm a fan of both.

Comment: I mumbled about it in another post, but The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky series is surprisingly great if you don't mind a linear story. Tons and tons of optional dialogue from NPCs around the world as the story progresses, to keep things immersive, and a very strong translation and technical port.

I'd encourage you to put into words exactly what your thought process was that got you from A to B.  We get so wrapped up in it "IT'S BAD" (understandably) that we lose sight of *how* the changes actually happen, which is exactly what we need.

I‚Äôm not sure if you experienced this, but at the end of cataclysm they introduced a new raid difficulty ‚ÄúLooking For Raid‚Äù which gives the ability for players to queue for raids instead of manually finding a group. Blizzard has made the game quite friendly to players that don‚Äôt have much time to invest into it.   So, I think it‚Äôs a great time to continue your adventure and get ready for the new expansion.

Comment: Nope, sorry, nearly 90% of those small businesses don't make much money, and pay a tax rate of anywhere from 0 to 20%. This will do nothing for them, and in fact the loss of some deductions and the rising healthcare cost it will cause will likely hurt them.   As intended, most of the benefit will go to the very wealthy.

Even for protection from short falls, I would want *at least* 10 kN strength, and that's assuming the carabiner is only supporting one person who isn't moving.

Comment: That was there at the same time, and if I remember correctly, the problem with the piercing selector is that it is being deprecated from the browsers not from angular itself. Because of this, and the fact that ::ng-deep uses the piercing selector, it will be deprecated at the same time.   Probably the angular team will come with a new way of doing this, but in the meantime you can still use it. And of course I will use ::ng-deep because I think that the angular team will refactor that and not create a new way :).

That being said, I don't really see the point of letting him know your interests a few weeks early (eg via email today) rather than waiting till school starts and you having an in-person conversation (eg at office hours), which would be more dynamic and intellectually fulfilling to you.

This is the simplest solution, and the one that doesn't require using additional media. There is also this: https://wiki.debian.org/Firmware  Note this part: *In some cases, firmware supplied on removable media may not be detected automatically. In these situations, drop to the console and manually mount your removable storage on a temporary directory (e.g.¬†/media).*

Comment: &gt;Shows how important it is to have a master.  Absolutely. I sadly have no access to a master in real life, but it seems that the internet and its resources are serving me well.  That said, there's probably no living person that respect more than Thanissaro Bhikkhu. If I was of any help to you today, it was no doubt due to his monastery, translations of the suttas, and Dhamma talks. I certainly consider him to be my master / teacher. If his materials aren't serving you well, I hope you're able to find instruction that works for you.

Comment: NRE might not last longer just because of distance. It doesn't work that way with me. But it does last a while. Think a year ahead.   Thing is. As months go by. She will have ups and downs with him. And you will always be there. There would be times when she wants and needs you. Be there and have open arms.   My husband had NRE with his emotional affair last Christmas. I had strong NRE with my AP last Christmas. This Christmas my husband and I are much closer again. And I love that feeling. I knew I'd never leave my husband, and I love to feel this connection with him again.   If your wife never had anyone else but you until now. She probably didn't have lots pig experience with NRE and how that fades. So she probably doesn't know that one day she'll want him less.   If you want to stay with your wife and decide to wait this one out. Just be patient. Another option is to put your foot down and make her choose. You might be on the losing end. Or... she might cut him off. If she cuts him off she will be heartbroken and you'll have that to deal with. She won't all of a sudden give you everything you now miss. Because she'll be grieving. For months. And he will forever be the perfect guy in her mind. Because it was a full stop during NRE. If it stops later on by her choice, she'll be over him in a whole different way.

People would always point out his late game picks but forget that he would have 4 TDs with 300+ yards in the air. Throwing a pick at that point might cost you the game but you wouldn't even be in it without those 4 TDs he already forced into tight coverage.

The AI that got good at chess really fast may be really impressive, but the real world effect is just an incremental hop from one boardgame to the next (or just getting better at doing the same thing). Adding new abilities and tying those abilities together into an AGI is hard enough to keep progress slow and manageable.

Comment: This is more or less my go-to list of useful info for beginners.  1. Do you talk to yourself? Think to yourself? Think while you do things? Direct that stuff to your tulpa. It's a little tough to remember to do early on, but it'll become an automatic process pretty quickly and it makes passive forcing way easier. Insofar as I'm aware, the only downside to this is it can make it a little difficult to not direct thoughts at your tulpa, so if they want to sleep or something, it'll be tough to not disturb them. At least that's how it is with me and Louis.  2. Are you talking to them? Did your mind give you an automatic-feeling sort of reply to the thing you said? Roll with it. Assume it was them. I know this is in probably most guides, but it took me hearing it from the community to actually accept it. Also don't discount things that are said if they don't make sense. Young tulpa have a hard time saying things. When Louis was just beginning to become vocal, he could just barely answer yes or no questions. Often when I asked him things, he'd say both yes and no, sometimes at the same time. It's just tough at first. Also, they tend to cut you off early into vocalization, or just generally reply before you're done speaking. This has often caused tulpamancers to think they're predicting what their tulpa is going to say, which has made them think that their tulpa isn't actually sentient, at least at that point. The reason they do this is because they get the idea of what you're saying before you can express that idea in words. Louis sees it as a matter of learning manners on the tulpa's part.  3. This one's also pretty common in guides. It's fine to make a tulpa by forcing personality traits during the early creation process, but it's incredibly important that you allow them to deviate if they want to. They're their own person and it's not cool to force them to be something they're not.  4. In a similar vein, I recommend not forcing any sort of roles onto them. You can ask them, but they should be the one to decide what they want to do. It can also be super stressful for anyone put into that kind of situation. They have to keep themselves in check to make sure they're maintaining your expectations, and failing to do that can make them feel like a disappointment. Of course, there's different levels to this stuff. There are healthy and unhealthy expectations and similarly healthy and unhealthy reactions to having your expectations not met.  5. Relating to the previous 2 tips, communication is absolutely key. It's the same as any other interpersonal relationship, but at the same time I've often found it easier to be entirely open with Louis than other people just because of the closeness we have. Be honest and open with your feelings, especially if there is an issue. Talk out solutions and explain why you feel the way you do. Be patient and willing to hear their side too. Be willing to reach a compromise if need be. Take them seriously and treat them respectfully. Stuff like that.  I think that about wraps it up for me. I hope this stuff helps.

Its not TERRIBLE, but youd expect more from a starwars movie. I am not a very big starwars fan but i was excited for TFA and Rogue One and actually liked both. This one has huge stretches that are boring, its at least 30 mins too long, nothing feels like it has consequences, some scenes are actually ridiculous and the best characters from TFA (rey, kylo) have less screentime. I cant explain exactly why i liked it so much less then TFA but i left TFA wanting more and looked at my clock several times during TLJ wondering how much longer it would go.

Comment: Well, by Scamco's standards, if a unit has built-in AA then it can't have Crit in the free dupe path and vice-versa. So I don't think that they will give him Crit. Likewise, VB will have counters so he can't be a type with free Crit. That's why I believe that they will just switch types and probably just be strictly better versions of the current ones.

Comment: If you decide to purchase a hardware wallet, I highly recommend you don't buy it off of Amazon. You never know what 3rd party sellers can do to them. I suggest you purchase it directly from the manufacture even if it means waiting a bit longer till it's delivered. If you're good with your hands, you can buy from a 3rd party, then look on Ledger's website on how to check whether or not it's been tampered with.

Comment: It is not called Replace Eyes tool it is Open closed eyes.  You should find it in the Eye tool, (the one for remove red eye). The Open Closed Eyes feature lets you open closed eyes in your photos.¬†You can open a person's eyes by using the eyes  from another photo from your computer or the Elements Organizer catalog. Open a photo in Photoshop Elements. Do one of the following in the Quick or Expert mode: Select the Eye¬†¬†tool and then click the Open Closed Eyes button in the Tool Options bar.¬† Select Enhance &gt; Open Closed Eyes. In the Open Closed Eyes dialog, you can see that the face of the person is marked with a circular highlighter to  indicate that the face is detected in the picture. Do one of the following: Click Computer to select a¬†source photo from your computer. Click Organizer¬†to select a¬†source photo from the Elements Organizer. Note:  You can select multiple¬†source photos if you want. Photoshop Elements uses faces from these¬†source photos to replace  the closed eyes in the main photo.¬†You can experiment with different eye replacements to find the best results.  Select a face in the main photo whose eyes need to be opened, and then click on any of the faces from the source  photos. Try different faces to find the best results. (Optional) Click Before/After to compare the results with the original photo. (Optional) Click Reset if you don't like the results.¬†You can use a different source photo to try and get better  results. Click OK. Save the photo with the changes.

Comment: &gt;  It was used as the primary means of demonstrating what a switch is capable of, and was also used as a way for Nintendo to test vario systems that we can only assume will be used in later installments of the open world Zelda games, but was by no means a complete game at least in my eyes.  As someone pointed out  &gt;But it was made for the Wii U?  They talked about it in their [Developer Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3092&amp;ab_channel=GDC).  [Edited to make shorter]  Going back to your point, everything can be considered a learning experience and indeed they changed their development method from [designing each puzzle independently with its own mechanics](https://youtu.be/QyMsF31NdNc?t=987) to [creating an engine that rules all game mechanic interactions in the game](https://youtu.be/QyMsF31NdNc?t=2376). It's like a "how well does it scale?" approach to Zelda game design (maybe at the cost of content that only grow proportionally to the amount of work, like story and settings and unique dungeons).

Comment: I think it was combination of things. while there was some excitement during Mobile World Congress in regards to it's modular aspect , I think that took a back seat when it came to it's design and materials. the competition (Samsung) was offering the S7 and S7 edge.. which looked quite premium when compared to the G5.   after it's release there was also the fiasco about it's non metal exterior, mainly because LG didn't make it clear that it was using a metal shell covered in plastic material. the battery capacity was pretty small coming in at 2800mAh and support for modular accessories was also pretty weak.   personally, I liked the design and cameras, but not the materials. the battery was also pretty weak in day to day use.

Comment: More than likely the QB chose to throw it. Which means they should address why Dak has the choice when he hasn't demonstrated he can make the correct choice, and also means Dak needs to explain his poor choices.

Then they fabricated the Russia dossier, which wasn't credible enough to be published before the election.

He wanted to punish you for what you did and even though that's what some people want to do after cheating happens, most of them don't actually do it, it's just a thought. A break up would've been enough, but attacking you, physically and emotionally (calling names etc) isn't alright at all. I know it's hard, but stop thinking about him. I mean, it's been over a year already.

Comment: Going to the police first, then going to the press seems a lot more logical. If the police actually do something about it the victim will get justice. If they don‚Äôt have enough evidence the press will cause the assailant to be ostracized. Also, if you tell people that you went to the police first, it brings a lot more validity to your story (Sucks to say that, but some people do lie about this stuff)

Comment: Are you *sure* you're reading what I'm writing correctly?  This isn't about the number of people *sending* messages at all.  It's much *more* about the distinction between un*wanted* and un*solicited* messages.  The latter are (almost always\*) spam.  The former *include* the latter, but also things that are *not* spam, such as cases where I *did* sign up (but now need to unsubscribe).  The start of this comment-thread was about remembering that while marking actual *spam* as spam instead of unsubbing is a really good idea, it's best not to apply it to things where you've only *since* decided you don't want it.  You don't need to convince me that messages you didn't explicitly authorise and that aren't from a person (rather than an organisation) whom you *know* are spam, at least the vast majority of the time.  That's not what the quibble was ever about.  Ganthid could probably have got the point across more effectively, and with less argument, by saying something like:  &gt; Do be sure to follow the "that you didn't subscribe to" part of OP; when you *did* subscribe, you should keep using the "unsubscribe" link and only mark as spam if they don't stop sending you messages.  \*: an unsolicited message could be from someone I met and never specifically asked to contact me, but who found my email address and is trying to get in touch for perfectly innocuous reasons; these messages are unsolicited but not unwanted, and also not sent in bulk.  They are therefore not spam.  They're still unsolicited emails, but marking them as spam when they aren't is counterproductive for *all* parties, myself included.

Comment: My best experience this year with the TCG was restructuring the drawers and shelves of my living room and then moving all the TCG cards into a crystal-protected shelf, safe from the cat, checking again over all my old stuff all over again. Still got most of the original base edition laying around.  Also, like a week ago I came back to the game after not playing since Steam Siege (before that I played a month during FF, enough to get 2 lucario-ex, then with physical cards for like a month during the 4th gen, and a couple years when the game first appeared, left the game right before og sneasel got banned). I've been following the live events so I kinda know the new cards and decks.  The only thing I had that still kinda worked was volcanion, so played a few games with it on the ladder. After like 10 loses in a row facing all the new stuff, managed to win a lucky game, instantly got the 1000 tokens from the box, bought the clanging thunder deck to consider going theme tournaments or at least theme ladder for grinding it faster and two Guardians Rising packs to start working my way on leles. Well, got one of them right out of the bat (and SR at it). The following pulls have given me 4 Aninetales-gx so I think I'm going to need to build that deck as well.  Then after doing some extra reading, apparently volc is still good, did a couple adjustments (namely field blowers, brooklet hill, acerolas and guzmas) and entered 3 24-ticket tournaments. Lost the first in the first round to a stall deck where I saw 1 supporter (acerola) in over 30 cards (and a kukui that got discarded by XurkiGX), then proceeded to win the 2 next tournaments, starting both against water toolboxes... with volcanion. That was quite a rush. Now considering getting some Zoroark-GXs with all those packs. Man this card looks crazy good.

Comment: Right now I'm running on a 4790k, 1866 DDR3 RAM, and GTX 1080 Ti. I average less than 5% reprojection at Steam SS 2.0. The main thing is using Lights Remover mod. For example in Vault 75, I go from 60FPS with maxed out GPU usage, to 90FPS with 50-60% GPU usage. It makes that big of a difference. That won't save you all over the place though, some areas of this game just aren't optimized very well. GPU usage sometimes drops into the 30-40% range and my FPS drops with it. Only Bethesda can fix that, but in my play sessions the average for reprojection is always under 5%.  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11076  That's the Lights Remover mod ^   &gt;

Comment: So if they replayed those final minutes, I suppose stuff like Harden's fouls would disappear?  Which leads to my real question: Is there any downside to fouling out other than not playing the rest of that game? Like fines or something. That game was done, Harden was frustrated with the result and calls and he fouled out. Does it matter at all?  I'm asking because in sports like soccer, if you "foul out" with a red card, you can't play the next game either, for instance.

You cant keep an economy running when the masses are poor. The stock market going up is good for the rich people that own stocks, (obviously) but the health of the economy itself rests upon the shoulders of the masses that drive it. When all the wealth gets concentrated at the top, the masses all run out of spending money and the entire economy collapses under its own weight.

Comment: I had someone call in today reporting the exact same. Unsure what causes it and an absolute bummer it happens. Do you have backups? If not, you can install macOS on an empty external drive and boot from it so you can hopefully salvage data. Copy from the internal to the external drive when booted, assuming the internal drive is visible.  I ended my call after advising my customer to procure an external drive and that's where we left it. I'm a senior advisor for iOS but not for Mac, so I haven't checked yet whether he's called in again and what the next steps have been, but I have a feeling his drive might be pooched as well.

No real damage to the environment, very simple maps, and limited cosmetics for the most part (unless you‚Äôre willing to pay extra$$$). I loved cod waw but this new WWII just looks and feels like it‚Äôs the same game as the previous cod without jet packs. If you‚Äôre in to a fast paced shooter with limited features and details go for it, it‚Äôs perfect for casual gaming. But if you‚Äôre trying to put hours in to a game, I would look elsewhere.

It A) let's you hat your own team and B) allows free split push value that the opposing team cannot handle. If your abby is spending more time hatting the monstrosity than the team this may not be the case, but it's often the better pick (including by QM win rate - your selection/memory must be biased). Especially at it is *the* hat build pick.

I don't even want a world tier boost, since it's basically the same thing.  If I am going to start over, give me a sequel in another city/setting and start me at level 1 with a new story.

All I ever said was then offense is not worse than the defense. We don‚Äôt need to play the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre trash without Rodgers‚Äù game because Rodgers is still a part of the team. When your QB1 goes down, you struggle. It‚Äôs always been that way with the exception of a few teams.

Comment: Al het vuurwerk is op dit moment eigenlijk al illegaal, dus in principe zou dat niets uitmaken.  Ik ben voor kerst en de jaarwisseling in Nederland, en een buurman hier loopt schijnbaar al sinds eind November flink met vuurwerk te klooien; aan de knallen te horen ook zwaar illegaal. Gezien het type persoon en zijn achtergrond is dit ook niet verassend.  Ik heb eens gekeken wat je nou eigenlijk hieraan kan doen, want het geeft ook echt overlast - voor ons, de andere buren en de huisdieren. Met hem praten heeft sowieso al absoluut geen enkele zin - dus keek ik naar meldpunten of iets dergelijks. Blijkbaar wordt er alleen _(mogelijk)_ iets gedaan als het gaat om het verhandelen/opslag van illegaal vuurwerk (politie) en/of zware vernielingen (politie/gemeente).   Er wordt dus op het moment al praktisch niet gehandhaafd. Wellicht dat het met een algeheel vuurwerk verbod voor consumenten uiteindelijk wat meer gehandhaafd wordt, maar ik ben er vrij pessimistisch over.

Perhaps you would have a galactic standard calendar based upon the original planet or some unifying standard. Depends very much on the culture of the galaxy, if it's unified that'll be very different to if there are a thousand and one independent nations.

Comment: Probably nothing.  But to offer an anecdote, a co-worker in one of the restaurants we managed was approached by one of his regulars.  The regular needed a job (was previously in graphic design if I'm remembering correctly), and had zero culinary experience aside from home-cooking.    Ended up being hired for his positive attitude and the fact that he was a regular and potentially trustworthy.  Either way, he stayed for a year until he was ready to move on.

Comment: Bulk trading is trading commodities between two stations. Like selling a hundred tons of gold to a manufacturing station. A loop would be to buy consumer technology at that manufactoring station to sell at the extraction station you originally bought the gold from. Laden just means full, so unladen means your cargo holds are empty, and laden means your cargo holds are full. You can check your jump range out in the galaxy map in the navigation tab. The jump range shown is your current, and the one in parenthesis is laden. (it's also shown in out fitting and in the right panel menu) You can mess with the slider at the bottom to see how it changes with cargo.   The best loops are always imperial slaves one way and some sort of high tech commodity the other way. So you basically provide the labor for a station, and the then bring back whatever they produce.  Also, a good way to make money withiut a lot of capital investment to begin with is to find an outbreak system and then transport medicine to  it. You get a  nice profit per unit.

Not many team in this league can have the luxury of having the best goaltender in the league, a top 3 goal scorer of the league over the last few years, arguably one of the best if not the best defender in the league. Your point pf having good player and none really outstanding is false. We do have outstanding players, we dont have a good system. We dont have a good farming club, a good recruiting system to help those core outstanding players.

Preferably organize the regulations based on distance of flying to accommodate  the needs of of different types of flying. Seems like pilots who fly across Europe or USA, for example would have different needs than pilots who fly around the world.  Who knows better than the pilots, themselves, what they need.

All that said - definitely the owners would not be keen on any workarounds as the reasons for the cap is because they otherwise do not know how to control themselves and they're conspiring, as one poster noted, to keep wages down.

Comment: I think doomguy could easily 4/10 without his armor, 7/10 with armor, and 10/10 with beserk. My reasoning for this is because doomguy himself is exeptionally strong, even without armor and his armor increases his speed and streangth a lot. Beserk mode itself makes doomguy an unstoppable rip-and-tear machine  with eons of fighting experience so i think he could win.

Comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8FexUydu48 Yes. I know that power loss is a thing and about ~15% on cars. However, dodge is telling their marketing department to advertise the 808 HP at the crank even though the car doesn't put that to the ground.  Tesla did mislead some people with those numbers, however, they are not wrong, technically.  All in all, I'd like to see WHP instead of CHP because it's not only more accurate, but its actually going to account for things like the weight of the car (Force of gravity), and also the drivetrain loss. Those things you can account for and are usually fixed forces that will not change as gravity and mechanical parts don't just change over quickly. The only difference we would see between the manufacturer's car and the dealership lot car would be things like loss of power through altitude, or octane rating per location. I agree with you though. Tesla did kinda make this a bit too exaggerated even though its true, and probably shouldnt have done that.   PS: BTW, I don't even care about power figures or torque figures anymore. With electric car's, you don't have as many engine performance requirements to maintain a certain acceleration rate. If the car does 0-60 in ~1.9, I could not care less about what the figures are. I wouldn't mind if the darn thing was powered by a hamster.  Happy holidays btw.

Comment: Despite having a computer at home in the early 80's, my school didn't have one, so our computer science classes used punch cards we had to write archaic code, we sent them off and the results would come back from a university mainframe after a couple of days.  Our teacher was firmly entrenched in that generation, and even BASIC was on the advanced side for her. Needless to say I was pretty much self taught, taking the course at school was just for getting the qualification.

Comment: &gt; It is left ambiguous. Palpatine seemed to think it was a success, the increased darkside resulted in the boy. Plagueis seemed worried it was the light's retaliation that spawned him. The actual implication of the book seems to be it was both, he would go on to be a great force for the dark, but ultimately a tool for the light, resulting in balance.

Comment: &gt;Brightbeak (LeapSlam)  Shield charge?  I also vote Brightbeak for the clear speed, even on a 5l the build doesn't really need any more damage unless you're doing guardians or shaper. Just swap in slower proj for gmp on bosses if you feel like you need the extra damage. Although if you haven't already I highly suggest getting some t16/17 solar guards as soon as possible

All of the top 500 companies have a revenue of not 200 million, but 5 billion or more. 61 of those 500 lost money last year. Are you telling me it is 100% because the bigwigs and CEOs make too much?

To get good mhs you need to tweak bios a little, regarding power usage - underclocking is needed. Preferably a little bit in bios, .95v is Fine for all cards. After you do that you Should get, hmm i‚Äôd say at least 26mhs. There are plenty of bioses on anorak (i think Its The website name).

We also carried boxes of teddy bears with little police uniforms to give to children and handed out candy at Halloween to the trick or treaters while also keeping an eye out on them. Glad to see some community policing coming back, it is more valuable than many departments realize to engage the public in positive ways.  ***Merry Christmas Everyone!***

Comment: Yeah, I'm not an insurance agent, and that caveat you're mentioning is probably what I was thinking of when I warned about fine print.  I also found this article: https://wallethub.com/answers/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-broken-pipes-19/  &gt;Finally, remember that water damage and flooding are very different in the minds of insurance agents, so if you are reporting flooding due to a burst pipe, do not actually use the word ‚Äúflooding‚Äù to describe it.

He got his degree from a diploma mill.  2. He faked being sane, just following the texts and sources he read to bluff his way through.  3. He had his breakdown after getting his degree.  4. His professor(s) were just as out of their minds as he was.

It's just so uncomfortable because they constantly say (mostly political related) things that just imply that everyone present agrees with them and all I want to do is scream, but I can't say anything because I know the topic isn't up for debate. The thing that frustrates me the most is *my mom and aunt* throwing serious shade on the #MeToo movement.  Anyways, just feeling very isolated here and very sad. Once I get a job, I don't think I'll be coming back to Texas every Christmas.

They say they want to win but they change nothing about their game to help the team win.  Especially vuc, he goes out there and gets his rebounds, hooks, and midranges along with all the three point attempts he wants but the most effort he puts in on defense is slamming the ball against the ground and inbounding after he let's someone go to the rim

Comment: I want to make sure I understand correctly. You live in New Zealand and want to buy some property in Southern Europe?   Buying a property long distance has inherent risks. You don't know the area very well. Who is going to maintain it and keep it free of trespassers while you are literally a hemisphere away. In your case, you'll also have to consider the difference in laws between where you are and where the property is. If you aren't *very fluent* in the language of the target country, there's also the possibility you'll misunderstand legal documents. I can muddle my way through a weekend in Paris, but I sure wouldn't try to translate a French purchase agreement!  Finally, I live in Las Vegas, a tourist hot-spot. I've had plenty of people tell me they want to buy a vacation condo (and in a couple cases, a party condo). The thing is that by the time you calculate all the costs of owning and divide by the number of days you'll really spend there, you probably come out ahead getting a hotel room in a really swank resort. As a bonus, somebody else has to clean and maintain it.  If you do go ahead, make sure you get people on the ground who know what you want and have helped others do similar things.   TLDR: It's a lovely dream, but really hard. Please reconsider.

Comment: Yeah, like I said, just imagine it‚Äôs around noon (sun is above you) and the moon is near the horizon. You‚Äôll see the half of the moon pointed toward the sun is lit up, because of course that‚Äôs where the Moon‚Äôs light comes from.   In this picture, the sun is more up and to the right than straight up, but you can see that half of the Earth is lit up; that‚Äôs obviously the half that‚Äôs pointed at the Sun. And looking at the ground, the horizon is pointing roughly the same way, so you‚Äôre seeing the ‚Äútop‚Äù (from the photographer‚Äôs perspective) of the Moon also lit up.   You‚Äôll have a hard time finding pictures of a whole scene like this because people can‚Äôt easily take pictures of the sun. But it‚Äôs not too hard to map out with geometry.

Downside is you‚Äôll have to add-on all the detail parts which is kind of a pain but in n scale you can‚Äôt really see them unless you‚Äôre right on top of them. If you want something right now FVM wouldn‚Äôt be a bad choice.

Comment: *I, Strahd* was written to be compatible with the Ravenloft **setting**, from previous editions.  *CoS* is a 5^th edition homage to that setting, but everything in 5^th edition is created with a mind more towards newer players, so "Accessibility &gt; Lore" is going to be the rule of thmb.  Any time they boil down an entire setting into a single hardback adventure, you're going to see similar simplification. It's just the way this edition rolls.

In terms of room of growth, XRB is ahead. But IOTA is working for real world applications. I don't see both of them as competitors though, they aim to achieve different things.   If we think extremely extremely long term, IOTA will be better. But short term, XRB seems way better.

Comment: &gt;In all cases selling an asset at its maximum value will be the best strategy.   You are fixated on this being  a maximum.  At any time assets can be either higher or lower than when you purchased it. I cover both cases. The CDP performs better when ETH rises. In this sense it's a great asset. If this post were titled "CDPs are always a great speculative asset" would you be so defensive?   Option 3 is not relevant because it doesn't involve asset A, so is not comparable. The only difference between option 1 and 2 is the CDP so we are scientifically testing the CDP. The difference  between option  2 and 3 is asset A. The difference between option 1 and 3 is the CDP and Asset A.   Only the comparison between options  1 and 2 is relevant.   Asset A is the perfect hedge. Both option 1 and option 2 should have the opportunity to use it.

Comment: Its not that, thing is that you ended up either gaining or losing post GST depending on what product you sold. FMCG and food products (which are mostly displayed in the info-graphic) got a good reduction from their earlier tax rates, so manufacturers like HUL are happy. On the other hand, textile raw materials in Surat became costly due to GST, so those textile owners took out a "GST satyagraha" few months ago. It all depends on where YOU stand.  Personally, I think its a good thing to reduce tax on consumable products that common plebs like us use.

Comment: Hi, I'm new to the game and rerolled until I got DV and Cloud. Funny enough, I got insanely lucky and got a Dark Veritas dupe and a Cloud dupe thanks to the 10+1.  I'm guessing I should farm my dupe Cloud's TMR and give it to someone? As for DV, people have told me he chains very well with another DV. Should I invest into my dupe as well? I've heard 7 stars are coming later to global so don't know if the investment will bite me later. Would also like to note I have an Agrias who I've heard chains with DV well, should I use her with my two DVs? Thanks!

Comment: It‚Äôs a bit taxing on resources and I think one would choose quality over quantity. Larger changes are taken more definitively than small changes.  Taken Macedon, Mongolia, and Scythia. All Calvary, dominating civs to some degree. Macedon is a temporary dominating power that has boosts to science and Culture. Scythia has a permanent dominating strategy and strength is religion. Mongolia has a slight trade boost with a highly mobile and permanent dominating effort. Almost the same, but these large differences makes for different game strategy.  To some degree, the comparison to Gorgo vs Pericles is the reverse. They play much more differently than some of the suggestions which seem far more minor. A small combat buff, a slight bonus to envoys, and some other things might not intrigue players enough to consider them a unique gameplay experience.

Yes, I have some top tier decks. Do I want to? No.  Yes, I'm a filthy casual but I'll let everyone in on a little secret. Unless you're getting paid to play Hearthstone, either because you're some e-famous streamer or an actual pro HS player then you're a filthy casual just like me.   Here's another secret. It's okay to be a casual gamer. You don't have to be all in or nothing. I play with my friends and my kids. I'm not going pro and I'm not trying to be the next Disguised Toast or whoever it is kids in HS idolize. (Nothing against DT btw, I heartily encourage new players to check out his guides) I just play for fun.

Comment: Thank you. Well, so I guess my question now is, if the virtual particles decay exponentially outside the light cone, and if the light cone is what I understand to represent being "on-shell", and if field operators commute with themselves outside the light cone to enforce causality, then are observable events always on-shell or not? If they are always on-shell, then isn't that just classical mechanics, and so what was the point of going quantum? If they are not, then doesn't that risk violating causality?

Comment: The following comment by \_\_blockcyph3r\_ was *[openly](https://snew.github.io/r/btc/about/log)* greylisted.  The original comment can be found(in censored form) at this link:  np.reddit.com/r/ btc/comments/7ls8u6/-/drp0n65?context=4  The [open modlog](https://snew.github.io/r/btc/about/log) reason it was greylisted as reported by /r/btc was: *Removed, account age less than required - please try again later*  The original comment's content was as follows:  ---  &gt; foolish mentality. who cares about volume traded on an exchange? don't get me wrong, it's an important metric, but BTC has plenty of volume from people who only buy/sell on coinbase and never transact on-chain

Comment: Well goty is subjective so don't know why you are questioning his opinion. Sure he could give it to Zelda because its more well rounded but Nioh is really fun. Too bad you couldn't enjoy it as much. I am sure you are not but I am also sure there are others like Jim who have Nioh as their Goty.

Comment: I use premiere because I like the ability to easily transplant items like high quality illustrations and after effects projects.   For basic editing? Just get familiar with one program before you give up. You're not gonna be making amazing things at first but for each video, just try and incorporate one new technique. Maybe it's making a wipe smoother or making some audio sync up better to the action. Just keep going at it slowly.

Comment: Before the Lightning Network can solve scaling problems, we first need to prepare the community for the responsibility of operating secure nodes. Transacting on LN is an active process and nodes require access to the unencrypted private keys used to manage their channels. If a node is compromised the available balance on open channels is exposed to theft. This is a significant difference from the offline transacting supported by Bitcoin. To get the full benefits of LN, users will not simply be able to secret away their private keys on airgapped hardware wallets.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l5bqj/the_best_thing_that_you_can_do_to_help_ensure/

Comment: Yo te puedo dar un contra argumento distinto, que es sobre el Colegio San Ignacio, donde estudi√©, y que Kast usa como argumento:  &gt;Sobre la forma en que debe implementarse esta nueva medida, sugiri√≥ seguir el modelo de arancel diferenciado que tiene el colegio privado San Ignacio, de los Jesuitas.   El arancel diferenciado implica que una familia puede postular a pagar hasta un 50% menos seg√∫n la evaluaci√≥n de su situaci√≥n econ√≥mica. Para que esto sea v√°lido el alumno debe estar de 3ro b√°sico para arriba y haber sido alumno regular el a√±o anterior.  &gt; Seg√∫n Kast, es ‚Äúel colegio que m√°s hace por la inclusi√≥n en Chile‚Äù por lo que considera ‚Äúgrave‚Äù que no reciba fondos del Estado.  No me consta de que sea el que hace mas por la inclusi√≥n. Cuando entr√©, el colegio era subvencionado, pero si bien recibiamos beneficios del estado como son los textos escolares y otras cosas, us√© textos Santillana y otros en varios a√±os, eso cambi√≥ a√±os despu√©s a usar solo los del estado, adem√°s el casino del colegio era privado (Sodexo). El colegio pas√≥ a ser privado por opci√≥n propia cuando se iba a votar una ley que cambiaba algo de las horas de arte/m√∫sica en los colegios, creo que fue el 2004 o 2005.  El arancel cuando entre era de menos de 90k, no recuerdo cuanto exactamente, cuando sal√≠ iba sobre 150k y hoy est√° a 300k (Pasaron mas a√±os en el primer segmento).  &gt;‚ÄúA las familias de m√°s alto ingresos les permiten que hagan un aporte, pero por ning√∫n motivo se permite que una familia que postula a ese colegio quede fuera por no poder pagar el copago‚Äù, explica.  Como mencion√© antes, para ingresar si que hay que pagar el copago, cuando ya est√°s adentro puedes acceder al beneficio.  ---  A lo que voy con todo esto es que el colegio San Ignacio no es el Saint Patrick de Machuca. Lo que se tiene es una inclusi√≥n maquillada, a la vez que el colegio se encarece a pasos mucho mas acelerados que el mercado. Era una talla t√≠pica en mis √∫ltimos a√±os que los de kinder eran cada a√±o mas cuicos, y las discusiones que se ten√≠an en clase con los profes sobre problemas del colegio siempre llegaban a que era una burbuja. No se de donde viene el comentario de Kast, que ya se parece un poco mas a la derecha tradicional.

Comment: Gahhh ignore mixed voice. It doesn't exist. You are either in m1 imitating m2 or the other way around. There is no split resonance. There is no m1.5. What kind of "mix" sound are you trying to achieve?

Comment: Deep breath. Life is not static. You can handle this. I love my cat too but he's old now. Its hard but all life must pass on. Look to the good times and remember you are NOT defined by these experiences. Things can get better.  Make priorities. Look to your cat first. If he or she makes it then great, cherish those extra moments. If not, your cat knew you loved him/her.  Look to college next. Your choice didnt accept you but other colleges will. Look for choices that you have, don't think about those things that have passed like that college refusal.  Of your parents I can only say this. They are people too, dealing with life. its hard for everyone but im sure they both still love you. They must make their own choice for their happiness but you will be the most important thing they both consider.   Don't let dispair take you. look forwards.

Comment: My sister in law brought this to dinner last night. It was amazing and I‚Äôm adding to it to the rotation.  2 chopped bell peppers 1 chopped cucumber  1 can garbanzo beans Halved cherry tomatoes Feta cheese  Olive oil  Lemon juice  Chop the veggies, add some lemon juice and stir. Add a drizzle of olive oil. Stir. Add some crumbled feta. Stir. Salt and pepper to taste.   My plan was to add some chicken to it for a lunch meal. But you could do canned tuna or chicken to this and make a healthy and filling meal.

Comment: "Jimmy G &amp; the 49ers upset the Jaguars"  That's the headline about us. We are at a point where losing is considered an upset (and a well deserved upset from the 49ers.) I don't know what dimension we are in but I'm not leaving it.

Comment: Sim, diariamente, por um ano e meio. Inclusive uma das atribui√ß√µes do meu trabalho era garantir que a produ√ß√£o fosse "√† prova de tudo".  √â claro que essas coisas acontecem, e √© por isso que h√° sistemas redundantes e mecanismos de controle de danos e solu√ß√£o de crises. Nenhuma ind√∫stria no mundo ter√° a produ√ß√£o parada por anos como o OP diz por causa de um √∫nico funcion√°rio fazendo merda, na pior das hipoteses parar√° por um ou dois turnos (o que j√° √© bem ruim) e depois voltar√° em for√ßa total (e provavelmente sem o funcion√°rio joselito).  Exemplos de coisas absolutamente terr√≠veis que aconteceram onde eu trabalhei e a produ√ß√£o n√£o parou nem por um dia:  Reator de 10 mil litros rachado de ponta a ponta porque o sistema de refrigera√ß√£o da malha interna sofreu falha catastr√≥fica e gelou muito mais do que o normal, fazendo o a√ßo encolher muito r√°pido. Produ√ß√£o parada por quatro horas enquanto o reator quebrado era desativado e substitu√≠do pelo reserva.  Contamina√ß√£o de um lote inteiro por C. albicans, e ningu√©m sabia da onde vinha. Produ√ß√£o parada por 8 horas enquanto uma equipe terceirizada fazia a higieniza√ß√£o da planta inteira e dos equipamentos, e todos os insumos descart√°veis eram trocados.  A produ√ß√£o foi retomada normalmente nos dois casos.

Comment: I backpack my KX2. I can't SOTA since there's not exactly a lot of peaks in north Texas. But I've operated from state parks. Here's my setup:  KX2 with dual batteries  10' jumper of coax   [LNR end fed antenna](https://www.lnrprecision.com/store/EFT-10-20-40-Trail-Friendly-p39885475) with a piece of shock cord at each end to prevent stress  [Arborist line with throw weight and bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VO2HZ0G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)  2 metal stakes to anchor the antenna and tie off the throw line  Misc - headphones, logbook, clipboard, adapters, etc  It works really well. I just throw the line up, tie off the antenna, then anchor it and connect the coax to the radio. If I was working somewhere like an actual SOTA peak, I'd look into something other than the end fed. Some sort of portable vertical would work well.    edit: [a couple pictures from my setup on Eclipse day](https://imgur.com/a/u2Kac)

Comment: &gt; I just can‚Äôt wait to go back home after the holidays are over, back to where my family can‚Äôt see me and I can just sit alone in my room in silence for as long as I want to.   I relate to that pretty intensely.  That was how it was for me when I was younger, and for years I blamed myself for it, instead of the toxic atmosphere they created.    &gt;  I have a lot of intense ups and downs but this is the first time in a while I have felt so okay with the thought of not being alive anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do.   Telling us a bit more about that might be a good way to start.  We can't magically solve anything, but we might be able to help you figure out some steps toward finding the support you need.    One thing I want to say.  In many first-world cultures we tend to think that our engagement with life is rooted in "reasons to live", but it really isn't as simple as that.  For example, there's some interesting research suggestig that the ability to perceive a sense of meaning is dependent on a sense of belonging and connection.  I've worked with suicidal people for a long time, and the biggest common factor I've seen is deep deprivation of understanding.  We all need people in our lives who really *get* us, and who accept and cherish our true selves, just as we are. For us sentient social animals, that's as great a need as air, water, and all other forms of physical sustenance.    I wish you the best possible holiday, in the circumstances.  Hugs.

Comment: You can get through almost anything in the game without having to actually do calculations.  You just need to understand some of the basic concepts of orbital mechanics... once you get a rocket launched.  Everything in the game builds on everything you've learned before, so you'll be failing a ton until it just clicks.  I spent like 12 hours trying to dock two spaceships together until it finally happened.  There are quicksave and quickload hotkeys, so you don't have to do *everything* over again, but sometimes the best part of the game is just watching your 2+ hours spent creating a rocket go up in flames on the launch pad.

Comment: Ranger, Druid, or Barbarian for the traditional Survival: Nature roles, but you could most DEFINITELY take a Monk class with a nature flavor (like training under waterfalls), or a Rogue like Robin Hood!    Many classes can be outfitted with character traits that optimize survivability, and taking the extra time to let their personalities and backstory grow into their environments can really enhance the roleplaying experience!

Comment: That sounds awful. Have you looked into homeless shelters or emergency shelters where you are? They might be able to get you into more stable housing as well, since most shelters aren't long term. However, a lot do tend to cater to women so that's good. Have you made any friends since your break with orthodoxy? If not, you may want to look into couch surfing apps/sites as well. Could give you a temporary reprieve. Also how can they kick you out of **grandma's** house?

Don't be afraid to get in there and break things, because that's one of the best ways to learn. And if you keep it small, it's easier to start over fresh with what you've learned.

Comment: It's not a poster. It's what's called a "fukusei genga", which is a reproduction original drawing by the actual artists. They come with a unique serial number, which means they are a *limited item* (also, hence the $300 price tag).  However, unlike the older fukusei genga [that are still on amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=bl_dp_s_web_0?ie=UTF8&amp;search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=%E3%80%8E.hack%E3%80%8F%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA), I don't believe these will be available online right away.

Comment: Warranted after how much CIG bigged up 3.0 then rushed to push it to live instead of just leaving it on the PTU.  The push to move it to live just seems to be encouragement for more funding, as it sticks people on a 90 minute insurance timer and restricts them to only using ships they've bought.  How can they call it an alpha intended for testing when they lock so much of the testing behind pay walls.

Comment: As has been stated multiple times by people at Marvel, those numbers we see report by comics site aren‚Äôt accurate by a long shot. The biggest thing is that digital sales are never reported. They aren‚Äôt public in the slightest. We‚Äôve already been told by Marvel editors that the digital sales for something like Ms Marvel are much higher than the physical sales. Probably not the case with America, but the overall numbers are gonna be very different than what you‚Äôre seeing on the surface.

You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).  This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*  Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:  **1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**  **2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**  **3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**  **4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**  **5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**  Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post.

Comment: Taking a walk/drive/anything where you are talking while looking in the same direction and not at each other. People find it easier to open up when they aren't looking at each other's faces and feel less awkward about pauses.  Opening up to each other and making yourself vulnerable (appropriately, don't go overly-attached girlfriend)  also helps relationships deepen.  Anything that makes you both laugh or smile when in the presence of each other. Even if it's the NetFlix comedy making you laugh, your brain will still associate it with the person you are with a little.

It is currently the de facto industry standard for digital still cameras. The file format of DCF conforms to the Exif specification, but the DCF specification also allows use of any other file formats.

Comment: In reality, molecules are described statistically by something called a Boltzmann distribution. So while the average temperature might be high enough to degrade collagen molecules, some proportion of molecules will be below this average temperature, and remain functional.   However, since this degradation is an irreversible process the amount of undamaged collagen will decrease over time as different molecules change energy during collisions.

Comment: Congrats My first term was mostly stuff that I was already familiar with,and I did about 35 credits that term.. My second was more difficult, and I made it through 24. I could have done more, but I wanted to save 12 for the last term, so that I had a full time status.  That being said, since I had quite a bit of time for the classes in my 3rd term, I actually got more out of them, and learned from them.  The classes I rushed through, not so much.  I read comments on here where people say, "don't try to do your best, do the minimum to pass".  So if a piece of paper is all you care about, rush through, but if you actually want to get something out of it.. slow down, breath and enjoy the whole experience.

Comment: Cool addition to VR. Still missing core features to make VR what most people invision as pie in the sky. It is cool that I can feel this car dashboard... But I can still put my hand through it... It is like room tracking. It is awesome I can walk around in this small space, until I hit a wall and have to teleport or glide.   There are serious obstacles to VR as immerse and interactive as Science Fiction often portrays. Most VR researchers admit that it is more likely we will eventually just use direct neural interfaces.  The only other option is basically full body haptic suits with force restrictions, suspended in the air, inside a bubble that imitates perfect sound, pressure, and smell. Even then.. How does this suit make you feel like you jumped into water?   It is super crazy to think that a neural interface is the more realistic option... but yeah.. You should look at the research Darpa is doing for this. Direct links into the cortex, even more so than just the science of how, but what should it be used for and how will the human body react. There was a call for research from them about a year ago to develop and test AR interfaces and what human beings could realistically adapt to with information pop-ups, as a side project for their neural interface research...  Here is the first link when just searching  https://www.forbes.com/sites/zarastone/2017/07/10/darpa-announces-investment-in-a-brain-implant-startup-that-wants-to-be-a-modem-for-the-mind/#25f2157c79d9

Comment: I would like it if the section pertaining to MMOs was optional (and the permadeath section also for the sake of MMO players who don't play games with permadeath). I don't really play MMOs (unless you count Don't Starve Together, which has set characters, permadeath, short sessions, no guilds...) so when I got to the questions about building your player character or participating in guilds I didn't know how to answer, and so I gave up on the survey.  I really like the idea of talking more about permadeath/roguelikes in a scholarly context - I've toyed with the idea of writing some sort of "Zen and the art of roguelikes" essay, as I find while playing roguelikes isn't exactly a form of meditation, it certainly shares a lot of similarities, and the permadeath aspect breeds its own form of discipline and ability to get past frustration - but I don't think this survey is quite set up for it.

Comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism  &gt;Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy **that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument**,[1][2][3]  The definition doesn't reduce it to changing the subject. Although I agree it was a bit veiled as "just examples", it's still the good ole "everybody does that" narrative, which is whataboutism.

Comment: At the same time, a marketeer can't market without a company's product, so they are worthless. A salesperson is the same. As is an exec, the tech support, yadda yadda.  Most jobs don't exist without a company and it's product, so you cannot say it's so heavily skewed when without the company there is literally nothing.  The playing field, as you put it, is founded on the back of the company to begin with. Of course it is skewed, but it's like being upset at the ground for gravity.

Comment: &gt; It‚Äôs just a way of extracting more money from a customer while providing no extra value, and we should criticize and avoid companies that engage in this style of behavior.  If the consumer agrees to pay the price, they *are* providing that value, by definition. The value of a product is what the buyer thinks is a good price to pay for what the product offers.  Value is in the eye of the buyer, it changes from person to person. If I don't think a product is worth what it costs I don't buy it, but other people will think differently.   Any company is free to offer whatever combination of features they want in their products, and any company is free to charge whatever price they want for every option. If nvidia wants to charge extra price for Tesla than for GeForce  they can, like BMW can charge more for a 328 than for a 320.

Comment: If you want to improve at league of legends a good mentality is always helpful. To this end, you have to understand and accept that there will be some games that you have absolutely no control over. And that's OK. However, what you do have control over is the character you move around every time queue into a game of soloq. Try to take any little mistake you made, anything at all, and work on it the next game you play. Even if this mistake wasn't the reason you lost the game or the main reason why you/your team didn't do well. You can't let other people's mistakes overshadow your growth as a player and to do so serves only to stagnate your skill level and willingness to improve.  The sooner you can accept this, and understand that you shouldn't let your teammates have any bearing on your mentality, the sooner you will improve.

Comment: &gt;And I take it Nords don't usually go for Alteration or Enchanting.  That's toxic nordidity right there. But all jokes aside, while it might not their races speciality, there were both an very famous nord mage and a very famous nord enchanter (Shalidor and Ahzidal). It might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but its not to weird for a nord to pick up a magical discipline. Especially enchanting.

Comment: It wasn‚Äôt several years in development for nothing. I bet Nintendo tried it and it didn‚Äôt work well for the emergent game experience BOTW has. I have a little bit of game design experience and can‚Äôt help but analyze game mechanics while I play a game. Non-repairable weapons make a lot of sense. They encourage you to experiment with different styles of combat, different ways of dealing with enemies, explore more and try new things in general.

Comment:   My experience with amcrest is that they want to be good but fail at everything except their sales division.  Technical and warranty support were a joke with too many hoops to jump through.  They are beginner cameras and should be treated as such.  The camera builds are subpar for the price.   I had 2 domes and 2 bullets, all 3mp as well as their NVR. I still use their 2mp ptz camera which is ok.    The NVR works fine.     Id stick with hikvision or even just buy regular Dahua.     Edit:  just looked at your link and I use that same ptz camera for the same purpose to keep an eye on my older dogs.   It gets the job done.

Comment: **SOLD SOLD SOLD**  **Price: $200 Net**  ***  Hello everyone, I have for sale SRPA21 PADI Turtle with one caveat.  There is a scratch mark on the case back from an attempt at opening.  Please see photo.  The watch has been regulated and running about +4 sec/day.      Rest of the watch case and crystal is in new condition.  It has only been worn a few hours outside.  The original bracelet is 100%, never been resized and worn.  Even protective films are still in tact.     I also have a Super Jubilee bracelet by Strapcode for this watch at 100% new condition.  ~~Being sold at $79.99 on Amazon I can also throw that in for 50% off at $40.00.~~ It's free, Merry Christmas!   Besides that not much to say, it's a reliable and well known Seiko turtle reissue.  I am selling it because I have way too many turtles at home now!     I have sold a ton of watches on /r/watchexchange, everything from new Tudor and Omega to vintage Seiko. 100% of my buyers have been happy and satisified with the experience. I will make sure that you are well taken care of and informed until the watch makes it to the door. References are always available upon request. Please feel free to check out my /r/WatchExchangeFeedback!

Comment: &gt; So I already contated bittrex about that now.   Bittrex can't do anything about it once the transaction was sent and confirmed.  &gt; Does anybody knows what happen now? So thats my main btc adress on the bch chain where the coins are now?!  The coins are on the same address on the BCH chain, but since you sent it to a SegWit address, while BCH doesn't have SegWit, things are complicated. It is possible to recover the funds, but it does require the active cooperation of a BCH miner (and they may charge a finders fee). Use these sites as a starting point:  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ej05e/recovering_bch_sent_to_segwit_addresses/ https://news.bitcoin.com/hundreds-bitcoin-cash-stuck-segwit-addresses-might-way-get-back/

Comment: The idea of wasteful healing isn't being accurately represented by anyone in this thread. Healing is only a bad thing if it comes at a cost. The reason that top-tier healers don't heal much is because any other heals they would output would cost them dps. If they had an extra OGCD heal that isn't being used, they would use it simply because it's optimal.   An example of this scenario would be: Imagine your white mage must cast ONE gcd heal. Your team is at 15k hp, and they need to be at 20k hp. Ignoring mana (because mana isn't relevant in the current tier), do you cast medica, or cure III? You cast cure III because it costs you the exact same amount, and has only a potentially positive effect. Potentially positive + zero negative = net positive :) The mentality of zero overheal is something that people who aren't that good at raiding created in order to justify why better people do what they do.  The goal of this game is NOT to minimize overheal. It's to MAXIMIZE dps. Often these are the same thing. Sometimes they aren't!

Comment: Technically you can have a biological male (or biological female) with the other set of chromosomes.  Because genes get transferred between paired chromosomes during meiosis, it is possible for this to happen to the specific genes on the X and Y chromosome that cause the fetus to develop as male or female.  So, for example, you can have a Y chromosome that has the female gene (DAX-1) instead of the male gene (SRY).  Then that gene would cause the female protein to be transcribed instead of the male one, and just like in a normal XX female, the fetus would develop as female.

Comment: The most absurd part of it all is that I never spoke about trying to conceive in my op. I was griping about my SO saying he will do something then not do it. Then I said I can't wait to have kids who will call him out on it. Little kids are like sponges who will recall everything you say. That was my thought process. Bizarrely, that somehow turned into fertility and my SO being an absentee father. That's why I deleted my op because it took an odd and nonsensical turn. Had I been talking about fertility in the first place then I would have understood the joke. I like dark humor and am usually the one making jokes that can make a room full of people cringe but his "joke" was unwarranted, misplaced, and rude considering his follow up comments.

Spend the money you would've set aside for your barrel on something else; a mask is typically the best shout, followed by things like a decent carbon fibre tank, pads, pods, pod pack, and so on.

Comment: Crab is the only clan with over a 50% win rate against Lion, and it's marginal at best, with around 52% from Imperial Palace statistics in the meta. Crab is the top clan right now, Lion is second place by a smidgen. Crane and Phoenix have a word position in third, because they both have marginally higher win rates against Crab, but both get their teeth kicked in by Lion. So there's this rock paper scissors between  Crab Beats Lion Beats Crane Beats Crab. Everything else is against lion is around the 40-46% win rate range. Sometimes Lion just flips cards and there's nothing in the game that beats them. On the other hand if Lion doesn't hit their threats you can break them out in two three combats. Lion isn't skill intensive, it's draw intensive.

Comment: The front camera/proximity sensor is a surprisingly delicate part. I've broken it with a slight bend of the cable while removing it before.  Fortunately, it's a very cheap part too. I'd try some of the software checks suggested in other comments, try reseating it, and especially chdcking for bent pins on the connector, but if none of that seems to be the issue, it may just be a good idea to replace the whole part.

Comment: I clocked out of the game a while back, I don't want to support a developer that has half the behavioral ticks as Activision/Bungie have displayed since the game's launch.  This game is clearly not about gameplay, as you can see everything fairly quickly. For most, like me, it's about collecting. Collecting is broken, for the sake of having to pay for it.  "No", is the shortest answer I can give.

Comment: This is going to be as objective as I can and as supportive to. Although a bit negative, the replies have a point.   Sadly, almost everytime someone who has any sort of good experience will read a post saying "let's make an engine that will compete with Unity and Unreal" and just walk away.  My suggestion would be "let's learn graphics, physics and some language and let's experiment together" and then take it from there.  You can be a very talented individual, but still a post with such little detail or lack of previous work examples tends to look beginner-ish.  All these points aim to help you perhaps redirect your pitch in hopes of getting people interested and someday getting you that kickass engine you talk about. Best of luck :D

Comment: If you can get a better (coated carbide) drill, you can certainly drill those holes dry and at a spindle speed that your router can reach. At 6000rpm and a quite slow feedrate of 540mm/min your drill will require about 1.0Nm to drive and consume 600W of power in 175HB AISI 1030 (close enough). I don't know what the torque cure for your spindle looks like, but those numbers don't sound unreasonable to try to drive. Feed thrust calculates out at 364N, which is a little less than 82lb.

Comment: i don't know, it looks traced to me. i'm not an expert, but it seems weird how they wouldn't fix certain things that could have been caused by photoshop filters..  over her left ear her hair looks chopped off, likely because the filters made that thing on her ear look weird, so they left it out. it seems like an artist would fill in those blanks. the dark space around her right ear and jaw line also look rounded like what filters will do.  also her jawline is kind of rounded out, i think that's from filters because an artist that was that talented would clearly notice and fix that or at least give it some definition.  oh, and eye makeup looks blended into her skin, as opposed to being on top. and what kind of artist would leave the eye lashes out of someone with eyes like that? especially when they went through the trouble of drawing every individual hair exactly like it is on the picture.

Comment: A lot of women have a TON of guys messaging them on Tinder. I've sent a second message as a last-ditch effort after she didn't reply to my first, and had her apologize and say she never saw my first one, and that she wished she'd responded to it. If she gets 50 messages a day, she's almost certainly not opening all of them. Which makes Tinder messaging a bad way for us to keep your attention.   Plus it's buggy, sometimes messages don't go through. So it's not ideal for like "hey I just got here, I'm by the bar in a red shirt" message at the start of the date.   BUT saying he will only talk on WhatsApp is sketchy. If she is down to meet me but wants to only do Tinder messaging, that's fine with me.

Comment: I think if you find something really unique that relates with League, it could be very lucrative for you. If you try to create content in a niche that someone already has saturated you're going to have  a tough time. There's so much content for LoL I just say you should try a few things and see what sticks.   I have noticed that actual coaching does get a good amount of views. Don't just regurgitate generic advice, but actual personalized vod reviews.  Another idea could be something to do with esports. There are a TON of changes for next season in terms of teams, players, etc and you could definitely create good content for that.  Hope this helped bud. I'll give you a follow on YouTube! Looking forward to what you come up with.

Comment: Look, I'll just say that the audible version of Voyager is 43 hours+ long.  The writers had to cram all the plot of a book that long into 13 hours of TV.  If you think this is easy, you've never written a screenplay.  So yes, certain characters aren't going to get fully developed, certain plotlines are going to be curtailed or struck altogether.  The writers do try hard to keep in fan favorite scenes and lines.    Some of my favorite episodes are in season 3.  "Of Lost Things," "All Debts Paid," and "First Wife."    There was, actually, a point when Diana was approached with a 2 hour screen adaptation for Outlander, which she very wisely declined.

Comment: Winter Soldier I feel is the better film but I prefer Civil War ultimately. It all comes down to the third act for me. It was personal, it was intense and it subverted my expectations at a time when I just kinda started expecting third acts to be giant cgi blowouts. (Though IMO it was with Ant-Man where marvel started stepping up their finale game). Also I'd be lying if I didn't say Spidey played a role in pushing it higher for me, though not to an irrational degree. His introduction was just very important to me.

Other times, it has been injured so badly that it's the humane thing to do. It's best to let them set the limits of what they want to discuss, I often ask about heartworm pills and whether it's a scam.

Comment: The Confederate flag was never officially any sort of emblem for the South.  First they used the Stars and Bars which looked nothing like the "Confederate flag" we know today. It looked too much like the US flag and a new one was needed.  Then the Stainless Banner which incorporated that design where the stars are on the US flag, but it looked too much like an instrument of surrender. Finally it was in the same location on their Bloodstained Banner.  The "Confederate flag" was the battle flag of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, but it was square.   The rectangular form that's such a "symbol" for the southern states was only ever used as an ensign jack of the Confederate States Navy.  A better symbol of the southern states would be the Bonnie Blue flag, but that's essentially been co-opted by the Dallas Cowboys and has lost a lot of it's significance.

Comment: Isso!!  Tamb√©m √© legal n√£o apenas definir as metas dessa forma, mas tamb√©m mensurar e acompanhar em ciclos de itera√ß√£o curta para que voc√™ possa fazer ajustes no caminho.  Eu gosto menos da id√©ia de metas e mais da id√©ia de objetivos e resultados-chave. Porque metas d√° uma id√©ia de que n√£o atingir a meta em 100% √© uma falha e pronto. Acho mais √∫til pensar em constante progresso e melhoria do que em metas.  Voc√™ define seus objetivos (e eles devem seguir a filosofia do SMART) e da√≠ vai constantemente medindo o progresso e adequando seus objetivos √†s previs√µes que as medidas que voc√™ criou te permitem fazer.   O lance √© voc√™ n√£o se fixar na meta como algo imut√°vel e r√≠gido, e n√£o ficar encanada√ßo com isso. Porque isso s√≥ traz ansiedade e nervosismo, que pode inclusive te atrapalhar nas metas.  O ideal √© focar no progresso e melhoria constantes. Meu objetivo √© ficar mais saud√°vel Um resultado chave para alcan√ßar esse objetivo √© diminuir meu peso em 30kg at√© o final do ano, o que implica perder 2.5 quilos por m√™s. Esse m√™s eu s√≥ perdi 1.5kg. **Tudo bem.** Estou progredindo. Fa√ßa uma retrospectiva e veja o que te impediu de chegar no resultado-chave, e trabalhe para mudar essas coisas no pr√≥ximo per√≠odo. O importante √© que cada itera√ß√£o leve a melhorias no seu comportamento, que te leve a chegar mais perto do objetivo.  SMART √© importante. Mas tem que tomar cuidado pra n√£o virar ansiedade e paran√≥ia. √â pra ser um guia de aprendizado e melhoria, n√£o uma fonte de frustra√ß√£o.

The bars are personal preference, just walk around and listen for music you like. Pop in, have a drink and find a vibe you like.  Aside from all that, get out on the water. Go to the dry tortugas (by boat or plane), do a group party boat, or look into chartering your own boat for a sandbar or private beach trip.

Sometimes I buy him a shirt or sweater that I think looks good, but wouldn't buy him something he won't wear because it's uncomfortable. I don't wear uncomfortable clothes either (heels, things that are super tight on my waist) and I'm pretty low maintenance. I think it depends on what kind of woman you want.

Comment: It's like /r/homebrewing and /r/cocktails have collided in my favorite thing ever.  As brewer and bar manager, A few other cocktails lend themselves VERY well to kegging.  Specifically anything with ginger beer, tonic, or soda.  I kegged up a kentucky buck (using strawberry syrup instead of muddle strawberry), and it carbonated to around 2.5 volumes.  It's so much better than even a fresh made one because of the fizz,  I do worry a bit about your lines holding that flavor though.  Look into Acid #5 from five-star.  It has done a really good job for me of taking smells out of stainless steel and keg lines.  Or just replace the lines, vinyl's cheap.

Comment: There's no drugs at Bonnaroo! Maybe you're thinking of another music festival? Also, I've attended Bonnaroo 6 times &amp; 5 of them I did solo. Don't worry about being alone. Make your home in Camp Thunderlips (tents only) &amp; introduce yourself to your neighbors. Bonnaroo is the most welcoming place on earth. If all else fails, find The Roochute. You will be welcomed with open arms. #neveralone #radiatepositivity

Comment: I learned fairly early on that the AW sub is where I go if I want to feel really bad about myself or get the negative side of things.  Comparing answers from that sub and something like this one or askreddit yields some really interesting result (I find ask reddit to be the one with the most varied responses for whatever it's worth).  I know that far from all women are like what you'd find in that sub but there are still a significant amount that are. Reading the sub from time to time is good preparation (for me at least) for if and when I run into someone like that IRL.

Comment: No, gift subscriptions cannot be combined into current accounts, you'll have to cancel your current one to use, which means reordering a new card. Worth it if they got the annual (such as from Costco), maybe not as worth it if only 3 months.

Comment: This might seem silly, but I had a similar issue with my Pi-Zero and you know what it turned out to be?  My micro hdmi cables couldn't be fully inserted when the pi-zero was in the official pi-zero case!        When I took it out of the case the cables could go just a little bit further in and it turned out everything was fine.     Is it possible that your particular HDMI cable isn't being fully inserted because of the case on your PI?

Comment: If you try to place an order, I think you'll find on most products that you get the message:  "prepaying customs clearance is unavailable".  I got that message for any card I tried.  Apparently they used to use Purolator and you could prepay everything beforehand.  Now however, from reading around, they use UPS.  You'll get dinged for duties, taxes, and brokerage fees.  Also note that free shipping isn't available for more than half of their cards.  When you look at the page, most will have a "calculate shipping" below them.

Comment: UCLA,UC Berkeley, Cornell all for Computer Science in school of Engineering except for Berkeley where I am applying for the BA Comp Sci program. Cornell aside, UCLA and Berkeley are the only UCs that use "uncapped uc gpa" in their admissions. All the UCs convert everyone's gpa into their own scale, using only 10th and 11th(where I got a 4.3w/3.7uw and 4.5w/3.833uw) but they cap "ap points" at max at 8. So although my combined 10th and 11th gpa weighted is 4.41, my UC gpa is 4.14w/3.773uw. However since berkeley and la use uncapped my weighted there for admission is 4.41/3.773. My freshman year was a 3.4/3.2 so it heavily skews my grades. Also I am international albeit I went to school in cali so that may be more of a burden for admissions. I think ucsb at the least is a 70 percent match since they are a top 50 comp sci school but aren't as ridiculous as the other schools I mentioned are. Btw you don't have to sugarcoat jack I am well aware that my uncapped albeit a little less important is far below the average at any of the schools I mentioned except for ucsb even when 3.773 is my 10th and 11th combined and with 9th it would be 3.6.

Comment:  Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).  This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*  Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:  **1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**  **2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**  **3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**  **4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**  **5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**  Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post.

Comment: Why not ?   It‚Äôs fast transactions, low fee, and made for smaller transactions. It‚Äôs also further secured by being merge mined with litecoin. It also has proven itself as actually useful outside of just a store of value (ie as a tipping currency on social media).  Plus the community is one of the best.  To be fair I think a few coins will rise and rise due to useful factor such as this (LTC, VTC, Etherum, Sia, and FTC come to mind) so why not Doge?  There‚Äôs room for multiple successful coins and Doge has seemed to prove that out of dozens of ‚Äújoke‚Äù coins it‚Äôs the top dog.

Comment: It's a description. Yes it's *called* the title. If it were called a rutabaga, it wouldn't simply make it a rutabaga.   Titles of that style are for books and articles. Not descriptions of funny cat pictures on a link sharing website.  Like I said, take a look at the front page. You'll notice hardly anybody does it that way, because it looks awkward and out-of-place.

Comment: Here's a question: why are legitimate emails I have subscribed to.... being sent to my junk folder? Why has Google's email filter gotten WORSE over the years? I was around when Gmail was a new thing. The spam filter was great back then. Almost none of my legit mail went to spam, and almost all the spam went to spam. Now I miss coupons and deals because half of them end up being sent to my spam filter (and I'm reluctant to add "never send to spam" to my filters/labels, in case I get phished by an impressive phisher who spoofs the email)

Comment: in that case, my understanding is broken. &gt;Whenever you think you need a Lifecycle object inside a ViewModel, a Transformation is probably the solution. &gt; &gt; how do you subscribe to the Repository from the ViewModel if you don‚Äôt have access to the LifecycleOwner? Using Transformations is a very convenient way to solve this. Transformations.switchMap lets you create a new LiveData that reacts to changes of other LiveData instances. It also allows carrying over the observer Lifecycle information across the chain  does this not mean that - do not inject repository into viewmodel ? I'm struggling to understand what is the author negating by specifically saying "*Whenever you think you need a Lifecycle object inside a ViewModel, a Transformation is probably the solution.*"

Comment: I am. I've made a lot of changes the last few years. I also work out a few times a week (judo), and try to do a light one at home a couple times a week at home (push ups/planks/stretches) - so that's helped with my flexibility and strength, but it does nothing for your day to day movement memory. You do need to know that what you're doing is actually correct, so checking in with a physiotherapist or a trainer if possible is a good idea. The other thing with the day-to-day correcting is that when you do it's a great time to do a quick stretch.

Comment: I've got ten, only about 8 people per session and we get through about 3 to 5 encounters per 6 hour session.   We meet about once a month so it's pretty focused. We've been at it for about 4 years and have been working on getting it to work with variable success.   What we've got now is most of the story stuff gets done throughout the week, through text, leading up and then it's just skill checks and combat during.   For the "just a dude in a crowd" I've been focusing heavily on having them come up with a backstory and tying those stories together. This way everything they go through has an emotional effect on each character individually but it hits them as a group.

You can't just Google "daytime pets that live in a small enclosure" and get an answer, there are a lot more people here and some know a lot about a specific animal or 2 and can help. I put in about 6months of deep research into getting my fish, and even my Hamster, where other people just ask the pet store what's right and end up with an unhealthy animal. There are so many reptiles, I couldn't possibly research all of them, I want suggestions from people that have an animal that could work for me.

He has been more durable in this scheme and sharing carries with the rookie. We should be able to take our pick of interior line upgrades in FA and improve the run game for he and Breida even more. Exciting times.

There are a number of large players (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Internet_service_providers_of_Russia), but also a bunch of small endpoint and regional providers.  Pro Net Neutrality articles refers to some examples, there providers blocked or slowed competitor services. From point of view of Russian laws this is examples of unfair competition, which is forbidden. Do US have some similar laws to prevent situations like this (except enforced net neutrality)?

Comment: It isn't that different, it is kind of just my own version of it. There is some differences though.... the normal search returns 12 results vs mine returns 20 and also does an additional search for each of those results in order to find the cattributes. Prices are also in USD and the search inputs are made to be really simple. At least I like being able to see the complete list of cattributes by category and using radio buttons/checkboxes.... if you like fancy animations that is a bonus too. I also plan on adding in the percentages for each cattribute.

It couldn't be easier, and I know I speak for lots of 40k players, and Tau especially: you'll kick yourself later if you don't give it a try, and you wind up attempting to pull off glued weapons to magnetize in the future

Comment: I cant give you any advice about medication use, but here is my 2 cents on getting adecent nights sleep.  Everyone is different, but if you have the same problem as me, which is thinking about pointless or depressing things when you are trying to sleep and stressing you out, then this is what I have done.  I watch boring videos to go to sleep. I play a lot of games, so I will find a gameplay video of the most monotone youtuber I can find.(sorry TrumpPH I love you still). Turn the screen off or face away from it. Listen to what they say, and think lightly about it.  Anything too exciting or with flashing lights is gonna keep you up, but something to listen to is great for keeping your mind occupied. Nature documentaires are probably good too.  They also have AMSR, im not too sure exactly what it is, but I know that alot of pepole use it. Look up AMSR on yourube you wiil get plenty of hits.  I would be more than happy to try to help , let me know if there are any questions

Comment: Alright... So.. There's a couple of things here.  Number 1 and most importantly this field is ever changing and evolving. If you can't find information on what you are looking for without having to ask a tutor or someone else then you probably aren't going to make it in this field. You need to learn how to read documentation, how to read old posts and take from what they said and apply it to what you are doing.  That being said... There's a difference between knowing what you don't know. And not knowing what you don't know. And for beginners, you don't know what you don't know. So yes I can understand wanting to come and ask people how to go about things. However, you should always try and do the research first yourself. If you can't get it or understand then post what you found and ask for a better reasoning, because right now it sounds like you want someone to spend time for free mentoring you and that usually isn't going to happen.   &gt;if you reduce the error of newer people their interest in the subject will remain positive  I mean this is just part of programming. We all have errors, and how you handle that makes you or breaks you. If you come across an error do you immediately get to solving it, googling it, looking at documentation, going back through your logic? Or do you sit there and pout and cry about it?

Comment: It‚Äôs nice to envision a company as a family, and I think every employee and employer ultimately benefits from fostering that type of relationship while they‚Äôre in business with one another. The employee wins because they‚Äôre treated with respect. The employer wins because when said employee departs, they can attract talent and garner positive reviews from having that kind of work environment.  To;dr: it can and often does make business sense to have an awesome work environment.

Comment: I have to go, so just quick reply before I do.  It wasn't 'cherry picked', I chose the largest block, with the most transactions.  &gt; If all blocks were full, this would be ~~5.4 million~~ 144 thousand tx per day, 1.15GB per day, 420GB per year.  &gt;Now, it looks like you've made a great number of (seemingly deliberate) misleading assumptions in your calculation; you cherrypicked block #479469, for instance, as the "full block example" and while it did contain 37k transactions, the other three full blocks seen on BCH (numbers 504017, 509060, and 496081) had an average of about 1333 transactions each. It looks like most full BCH blocks are processing considerably less than half of the transactions that fit into a typical (~1.1MB) Bitcoin block.  Now it seems *you* are cherry picking blocks that suit you! :D These full blocks you list have low tx count because they are unusual, they are full with 100 input 1 output transactions, it's also the reason they are the biggest blocks, they are not representative.   If you look at the [top 20 blocks mined](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks?s=transaction_count%28desc%29) on BCH with the most tx, you get slightly *more* capacity than my original quoted 479469 block. (average 41416 per block, 5.9Million per day)  I will say that I am choosing the top blocks on purpose, because low tx count blocks are also not representative of future block as overhead distorts the picture of real future blocks.  I do not know how to find the average tx per KB on BCH blocks, if you do, please reply with it here, and we can re do it with that number. It will most certainly be closer to my block 479469 than your three listed blocks, the top 20 come out at 202 bytes per tx, very reasonable.  Talking on Nielsens Law and Moores' law relating to my post are all done assuming that the current hardware / network requirements are maxing out what is currently available ... absolutely worst case scenario ... and that is not true, my core node, running on a $40 Atom based PC, is on a 1GB fibre connection today, it costs me $80 a month, that I pay anyway. I don't think scaling up from current bandwidth requirements is a stretch at all, especially with improvements in protocols that will come in the next 17 years.  I also disagree re bandwidth. In an optimal system, with the 48611111 tx per block @ say 220bytes per tx, that's 10.6GB * 2 = ~20GB per 10 minutes = 33Mbps, 1/30th of my connection *today*. CPU is a much more meaningful bottleneck IMO  &gt;we run into a huge problem: this block only included $107 worth of fees.   yes $107, but for 37814 transactions, 0.28 of 1cent per. Of course the system wont move from block reward to fee supported if the transaction count doesn't go up, that is the same for any coin.  Now, using my "super cherry picked" block that is low compared to the average of the top 20, and extrapolating, that is the 48611111 tx per block * 0.28 of 1cent = **$137551**  That's **36 times** the $ reward of that same block today, and doesn't take into account any price increase of BCH, that means you could run even lower fees than the 0.01 USD per KB in that block.  (Bitcoin has had zero trouble going from 50 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block, with fees no where near making up the difference, while keeping orders of magnitude more miners profitable due to price increases)   I am very tired, there could be errors above, feel free to point them out, but don't falsely accuse me of cherry picking data, and then pick the most non representative data available to rebut me with!

Comment: Truthfully, no, not really. Truck drivers normally have a lot of pride and consider themselves professionals. Half of drivers don't make it through their first full year, so if you chose driving as a career just because it's "badass", you'll probably be one of those who don't make it.   Truckers have a far, far, better safety record than non-CDL drivers, and something like 80% of truck-involved accidents are the other drivers' fault. Most drivers I met on the road thought of themselves as professionals, and took safety seriously. It's not all macho thugs and young tweakers.

Comment: Its not a simple solution. Blocks are 1mb in size, if the blocks were increased to 8mb 90% of home computers wouldnt be able to run a node. You can search for bitcoin nodes vs bcash nodes and you will see this logic in reality.  To compete with visa and mastercard blocksize would need to be 6.4gb. Which gets sent accross the network every 10 minutes. Many many nodes will fall behind meaning only businesses and rich individuals can afford to run nodes. At this point the governments will be able to shut it down.  I suggest you find your answers to this debate outside of reddit. Theres very few technically qualified people here which is why weve ended up with the blocksize debate in the first place.

I own it through steam and she has it through social club, installed both and neither will run.  -  There is one thing I need to try, which is disabling the integrated gpu through the bios so it forces the nvidia one, however I cannot get into bios. You boot the laptop and straight to Windows splash screen, tried using the advanced reboot which is supposed to give you the option to boot to the uefi settings, however the option is not there for me. And I don't know any other way to get into the bios.  -  Have you any idea what other subs I could post this in for help?  But honestly, thank you so much for replying

Comment: Unless you find your dream house, I would recommend waiting until the spring/summer to buy if possible since there will be many more houses on the market then (though there will be more buyers then too).   The DC area is very competitive, so I would not hold out hope for a drop in price/demand.  Also, time to close can be a factor in whether or not your offer is accepted. We had to switch from a good credit union to another lender because the 45-day time to close at the credit union was too long for sellers. I'm not sure if it takes longer for VA loans vs. typical loans, but that is something to consider.

Comment: She gave you a very generous timeframe to answer her, and instead you ignored her for 3 weeks. Yea, this is on you. No real way to sugar coat it, you took your sweet time and she moved on. I get depression makes it hard to communicate, I mean I've had severe depression for 4 years, but you didn't even try, now you can't blame her for finding someone when you were ignoring her.

Before I did, I took another look at it, and it dawned on me - this actually looks more like Jimmy G!  So I'm going to repaint this to match the new uni with Jimmy's name and #10. If any of you still have this figure, you could probably do the same!

I've met her, met Pebbles, and brought a neuron back to her (But only one, because the info I had seen was unclear, so ow I think I have to bring her three more still? Ugh.). I'm on my way to find the Farm Arrays now.  I basically just asked this because in games like Dark Souls, you can mess up NPC questlines if you do things in the wrong order, and in Hollow Knight, you can't get the standard/"bad" ending once you meet the criteria for the good and best endings. I just wanted to make sure I didn't have to replay large sections of the game later to get an achievement or ending I could have gotten the first time around, that's all.

Comment: One of the requirements of the idea of a space elevator is that the orbiting body be in a geostationary orbit, of which the Moon is not. Another major requirement is an extremely strong and extremely light material, a material that, I should note, has yet to be invented, though we might solve that in the next 10 years.  Now, some fiction.  - If you had a magic pole strong enough to attach the moon to earth, it would rip out both sides and likely fly off into space. Or perhaps it would settle on earth somewhere and sink below the surface like an arrow to the head. - If you magically moved the moon into a geostationary orbit then it would have major consequences for the tides (I believe they would stop or slow significantly) and weather (the tides help distribute energy around the planet)  Your best bet is to use a space elevator to get to a geostationary platform and then take an easy flight in a space bus over to the moon.  Edit: I don't know how I repeated myself so much...

This isn't some standalone film, it has to adhere to what happened directly preceding it, and it completely fails at doing that.  This movie makes it very obvious that there is no overarching plan for this trilogy and that the two directors didnt communicate at all.

I definitely feel our texting vs hanging conversations are so disproportionate.   But I would say that you should just see how it goes on New Years. Maybe slow down with the texting. Text or call her in the evenings and see how her day went rather than text all day.

Comment: Friendly meditation is included in the Preparations mod, so you don't have to get both. As for the others, try merging each category one at a time, for example Meditation and HUD first, then if it clears, the next one. If there's an error, don't merge the two. Also, only merge the ".ws" files, don't touch the ".xml" conflicts. Just use the priority numbering for those.

Comment: &gt; as you may cast a female actor who only partially fits the character, instead of a male who nails how it was written perhaps)   That's not really the case as the characters already have genders when written. Background artists, this might be true, but we are talking about named characters whom the writers already know what gender they want that character to be (given that all the scripts were written before production started).  &gt; but also restricts the scriptwriters in what lines they can use.  This is only partially true as this far into the future, gender divides aren't tremendously important, although they did give Alara the running gag that nobody wants to date her because of her strength which was interesting.  But in terms of what lines characters can say, it's not hugely affected by what gender they are, especially since the recurring characters OP is talking about are mostly bit parts who get to deliver a line or two that is usually either situational or occupational.  To illustrate that the Orville does know how to do gendered conversation well, I draw your attention to the split conversation between Alara / Grayson and Isaac / Mercer where basically the same conversation is being repeated (why Ed and Kelly split up) but one side shows the female perspective and one side shows the male perspective.

Comment: Well, points 2 to 4 didn't apply to me, but I don't think microtransactions are inherently increasing, nor is it a necessarily a bad thing. For the former, I think the newer game delivery systems means we are more aware of more games coming out, so it could be that the MT raid is constant and we're just exposed to more of it.  As for the latter, MTs can prolong the profitability of a game, thus incentivizing the developers to continue developing/releasing new content for it. I would be against misleading MTs (e.g., advertised to have X but instead it gives you Y with only a tiny chance of getting X), but in general I don't really want to tell adults how to spend their money.

Comment: I was writing down extensive diary entries and school to-do lists, etc for years. I would buy cheap 1 dollar notebooks and I would write down detailed step by steps for each assignment, which in theatre, can be 3 pages long.  I was bullet journaling before I knew what it was.  Sometimes I would doodle on them, or draw out how tos, etc but nothing crazy.  I slowly started to do what I consider is more scrapbooking than bullet journaling (but this thread calls it bullet journaling) without knowing it.  I have a background in art, but my current layouts for appointments/to-do are simple. Maybe an odd sticker or highlighter to add to it a bit but nothing fancy. My diary entries informal. I use different pen colours based on my mood/personality or event when writing my thoughts.   The arty stuff is more just for fun. To relax. Only one full art layout I fill in is a tracker of films I watch; where I write down what I think is the elevator pitch and the nugget. I drew a simple film camera.  You are right, a lot of stuff on here is not practical (for me) and a lot of it IS perfectionism.   Sadly those Pinterest type of entries get the most votes. Why? Because they give people the idea that perfectionism is reachable.   Then you get these entries of people unhappy with their bullet journals because they can't get theirs like the upvoted ones.   It has become a popularity contest.   The journal needs to work FOR YOU.  Just do what you want to do with your journal, try new things, scrap things that don't work, and just have fun. Forget about this thread.

Comment: Menuda cacao que tienes Juli√°n.   Primeramente el tal llamado refer√©ndum de 1/O no tiene ning√∫n validez por haber sido declarado ilegal desde el principio. Con lo cual solo acudieron a votar los que estaban muy movilizados por la independencia. Es como si se hubiera hecho una encuesta y haber asegurado que solo responden los que dan una respuesta determinada. Adem√°s ni los mismos observadores que ellos hab√≠an llevado no dieron validez al recuento de los votos.   La implementaci√≥n de la independencia unilateral fue abortada porque el President y unos cuantos de sus concejales salieron corriendo y no pararon hasta llegar a Belgica, escondiendo cobardemente en aqu√©l pa√≠s en vez de quedar y dar la cara y a defender a su Rep√∫blica reci√©n declarada. Y el Estado Espa√±ol ejerciendo su derecho constitucional utiliz√≥ los medios a su alcance, que son muchos y poderosos, para defenderse de la DUI. Como es l√≥gico. ¬øQue se cre√≠an, que se iban a quedar con los brazos cruzados viendo como Catalu√±a se independiza?  Puchi tuvo su oportunidad de convocar las elecciones. No quiso hacerlo. Se asust√≥ de la posibilidad de perder la popularidad cuando le llamaron traidor. Entonces no os quej√©is que lo hizo el Gobierno.  Y lo que m√°s, se te han olvidado unos cuantos votos en el tintero. Ya he visto esta manera manipulada de contar que deja los votos no-independentistas en clara minor√≠a contando solo los votos de C's+PSC+PP. ¬øPero qu√© pasa con los votos de CeC, por ejemplo? ¬øNo votaron? Ni los partidos que no consiguieron esca√±o. Pero votos s√≠ tuvieron y no eran indepes. Hay que sumarlos en el bloque no-indepe y son m√°s de 50%. As√≠ que te pongas como te pongas, los indepes est√°n en una clara minor√≠a en votos. Otra cosa son los esca√±os pero eso es otra historia.   Con esto ya tienes suficiente refer√©ndum, no hace falta m√°s. Mejor que Podemos se dedique a cosas para lo que fue creado, u sea, defender a los derechos de los se han quedado debajo del rodillo del PP.  Aunque si te digo yo estar√≠a dispuesta de conceder la independencia a Catalu√±a pero ya. En un tiempo r√©cord. Justo lo que se tarda colocar la frontera con aduanas y all√≠ que te lo compongas. Y si te he visto no me acuerdo. Que hartura, pordios.

Almost everything you would do with GPUs in a datacenter would benefit greatly from datacenter-specific drivers. And it notes that there is an exception that allows use of the GeForce drivers if those GPUs are being used for blockchain processing.

Comment: Question about AVRs. So if I understand, it would be better to buy an Outlaw amp (model 5000, $600) and pair it with something like the Yamaha TSR-7810 ($400 today, pre outs) as opposed to an all in one options like the Yamaha aventage a2070 or it's equivalent? They would be similarly priced. What would I be missing foregoing the more expensive Yamaha (or any similar AVR) all in one models as far as sound quality goes?   I have 4 KEF LS50s and two SVS NSD12 subs. They are low ohm speakers. I'd like 4K and HDR capabilities, which is why I picked that Yamaha model as an example, but anything with pre-outs would be ok. And I really like the idea of separates since I'd only need to upgrade the processor each TV upgrade.

Comment: Yeah I've really enjoyed my time in the program; the teachers have been great for the most part and the lessons are very valuable. One piece of advice I can give is ask a lot of questions and always get feedback on your work from them. They are all very experienced and crazy knowledgeable people who all want to help you improve so seek it out whenever possible. The course load isn't too bad honestly; I've talked to other people in similar 1 year VFX courses at VFS and Vanarts who all say the work load is more intense but since Capilano is spread over two years you have much more time for your own personal growth as an artist as well. This ties into what I said before about asking alot for help, since I'm sure you know the only thing that matters for getting your first job is who you know and what you can do; so work hard on improving your skills, not necessarily on your assignments if they aren't going to be useful for your desired career path.

Comment: I'd guess less than 20% on a business heavy route. Maybe 40% on a leisure heavy route.  In the event of an emergency landing, if we have time, we do another, more succinct demo. I can't think of anything I'd change.   We change our video every once in awhile, which seems to help keep attention when the new one is out.

Comment: It is also very useful when navigation along the coast.   [This is an interactive nautical chart](https://kartor.eniro.se/?c=59.119411,18.411026&amp;z=13&amp;l=nautical) of a region in the Stockholm Archipelago.  All the star thingies with a green and red ring around them are light houses. Note the yellow cones extending from the light houses. This is the area in which the lighthouse shines a white light which mean there are no grounds/shallows/islands between you and the lighthouse (kinda).  If you know which lighthouses are the current ones on the route you are taking (the dashed lines) you can safely travel by just going from one lighthouse to the next, always going towards them as long as the light is white.  Note that this can be done in complete darkness, when you cannot even see where the islands end and the sea begins.

Comment: While I definitely agree with you that people are entitled to their own opinions, I think the reason this movie has sparked such debate is because of the sweeping implications it has not just for future movies, but also retroactively for the previous films. Along with the OP, and as someone who was considerably disappointed with this film, I personally wish more people were upset. Not because my opinion is more valid than anyone else's, but because I wish there was a higher standard for stewardship of the franchise. While I do agree that TLJ was a cinematically brilliant movie, I think the bar should be higher when it comes to treatment of its predecessor as well as star wars fans in general. But again, that's just my opinion. :)

Comment: Date on page:  &gt;Published on Nov 2, 2016  Actual title of page:  &gt;Want to rig the US presidential election? Good luck.  From the submission guidelines that are clearly posted on the right side-bar of this page  --&gt;  &gt;Articles must be published within the last 31 days.  &gt;Post titles must be the exact headline from the article.  By the way, nobody claimed the presidential election was rigged with the methods described in that video.  That pretense otherwise is a straw man of the allegations that Mueller is investigating.

Comment: people forget that the gaming industry is still a business. these companies aren't going to waste money on scaling up infrastructure for one day of increased traffic. it's just the unfortunate truth. the eshop was working fine yesterday and it will probably be working fine tomorrow. the people who are trying to spend their money right now in the eshop will just end up spending their money tomorrow or later in the week. it has nothing to do with negligence or poor planning. nintendo knew this would happen but figured it wasn't worth the cost to mitigate it.  if you disagree with their mentality, don't support them. although I highly doubt people will boycott nintendo products over their inability to access the eshop on christmas day. so basically, it just is what it is.  *this is all just speculation and my opinion of course. keep in mind I am just as upset because I can't buy zelda right now.*

Comment: Find a Sangha and meet an enlightened teacher! Just do it -- clear up the whole issue of what's possible by practicing with people who are embodying it moment to moment, every day. And then confirm it with your own direct experience.  There a saying that "even Buddha is only halfway there", but that's a misstatement. We don't know the range. But even Buddhas still continue to teach and radiate blessings.  In a way, it's much easier just to try, completely. 100% just try. Then the whole question of what's possible is left to the way things really unfold rather than speculating and wavering and wondering, and being part-in and part-out, and going around and around in circles in life. When you go all-in, you're not constantly guessing and second-guessing; you just do it.

If Rand Paul was correct recently, stating that we spent $250m building roads in Afganistan, while our fellow citizen's are dying in droves from the opiate epidemic, then what the heck are we doing to ourselves? We should spend less on foreign aid and military. and focus more on education and social development in our borders, including manufacturing.

Comment: I would definitely try to experience this game. The freedom the game allows is novel, not just in the mechanics but in the design. Modular and non linear. Story is a little flat but the game loop is very addicting- see a mountain on the horizon you want to travel to,having a bunch of cool experiences along the way, getting to the top and seeing another location to travel to, then getting to hang glide down. The durability of weapons always breaking takes some getting used to but i realized for me it makes the game more interesting and there's always another to be found. (Late game might even be dull when you have 20 OP swords and one unbreakable, so the challenge of breaking weapons is good imo)

Comment: Hm, I'm biased since I'll read any X-men based stuff.  But definitely yes to all of X-Factor.  Volume 3 is probably one of my all time favorite comic runs (well first couple years anyway).  Excalibur is worth a read as well.  That limited run they did in the early aughts I thought was fantastic.  Generation X is ok.  Probably my least favorite of the 3, but still decent.  I'd recommend New Mutants over Gen X myself.  Did you read the Yost X-Force reboot from 08?  Good stuff there too.  As long as you're doing 90's X-men, get the Fatal Attraction arc.  &amp;nbsp;  I'd also like to mention that my hometown didn't have a comic shop.  So I had to get comics in 3 packs from the grocery store as well.  Downside was you could only see the front comic.  Which was usually a popular title like X-men, Spider-man, or Batman.  Then you'd get a comic from one of the lesser lines like X-Factor, X-Force, etc.  Then you'd get a comic from some random non-big 2 publisher.  Made it darn near impossible to get an entire story arc.  &amp;nbsp;  Edit:  And if you haven't read the Claremont run.  Do that.  His decade plus original run essentially defined what we know of the X-men.  Plus classic storylines like Phoenix Saga and Days of Future Past.  When he came back I thought his stupidly named Extreme X-men was also pretty good.  Then there's Morrison's run on the X-men.  Well written, with interesting stories and a few questionable overall themes.  But worth a read.  Can't forget Whedon's Astonishing X-men either.   &amp;nbsp;  Recently read the Cable volume 2 and loved it.  Thought it was a fun scifi/escape book.

Comment: I think you are doing great. The last thing you want to do in this situation is step on any toes. The best thing you want to do is form a good co-parenting relationship between yourself, your partner, and the baby daddy. It sounds like you're doing a great job of that. Keep doing what you're doing.   Since you clearly want whats best for the children, but you're not 100% sure how to go about that, it might be a good idea to ask your girlfriend about organising tonjave a conversation between the three of you to establish what everyones role is, particularly during in person visits. You can all talk about your feelings on the situation and what kind of role each of you wants, and then work out how you can all make it work together so the kids get the best of all worlds.   10 points to Gryffindor for being such a good step parent and considering bio-dads feelings.

One thing I'd add is we had an outside company funding the project, so we had to give them some presentations and make sure they understood our thought process and everything.   Another thing is that if it's a long-term project and you leave before you obtain the necessary results, you may have to help out the new team members and get them up to speed.

Comment: Even living in an area with terrible odds (a town in Utah so the religion makes it hard for me and also a town which attracts a lot of young men due to military and manufacturing being the main industries) and not having much luck on tinder I got more than zero matches. Now I only got a handful of matches I would have actually consider meeting but and they often wouldn't respond to messages anyway. Most matches would be the result of over swiping in a binge and we're very low quality people, no common interests, not attractive, and generally complete disasters. And I am in pretty good shape and had pictures that prove it (backpacking and wakeboarding pictures not mirror selfies), have my life together, my own place and and a good job so in theory I should have got reasonable matches. But online dating really sucks.

Comment: Reading the article compared to the post headline makes it seem kinda sensational. ‚ÄúSe preparan los √∫ltimos detalles para convencer a Carlos Carmona‚Äù means they are preparing the final details in convincing Carmona. Sounds like Carmona is still undecided. If anything he will get an offer on the table next week and decide/negotiate if he stays or goes. I‚Äôm pretty sure El Tata will have a pull on his decision to stay or go too. Personally I want him him to stay at least through next season, he‚Äôs been pretty solid for us.

Comment: Did you skip over what I said? If there's no one living in rural areas, there's no agriculture, no resource gathering, no mesh between metropolises, which are all necessary for the basic functions of a country.   But there's not much point debating this point to you if you just are going to hate rural people for being rural. They're not "backwater" just because they're not living in urban places. Can't really blame people for dividing the country when you clearly hold so much disdain for a group that isn't one solid block of people who are all the same for you to hate.  EDIT: Btw, you can talk about generating the most of the economy, but there has to be a negative investment somewhere to be able to turn it to profit. A majority of the stuff the urban places are making so much of our gdp from has to come from a rural area.

The Jones Act penalizes Puerto Rico even under normal circumstances and only benefits the shipping lobby.   As president, he is not "going out of his way to help" anyone. It's his duty.   And if he didn't respond no one would know what anyone thought of him in Puerto Rico. But he does respond because looking like a bully wins him points with his disgusting base who apparently values that in a "leader".   His thin skin shouldn't guide policy and you should expect more from your president.

Comment: Why only $10 if you live with parents? It would just seem as though you could save a bit more without bills. I'd encourage doing so you can maximize future savings through investments and such. I don't know your budget so If $10 is all you can save by all means continue, but if you can put a bit more in I'd definitely consider that instead.

On Tinnitus boards its called reactive or 'kindling' tinnitus, but others say that its a form of hyperacusis and that reactive tinnitus is a made-up term. If you search for "reactive tinnitus" on Tinnitus Talk, you'll see more people describing it exactly the same as you, for most people it subsided after some time.

Poker, OTOH, I argue is NOT gambling, at least not in the same sense. It's a game of 95% skill, where luck plays a hand (pardon the pun) but the house is never tilting the odds.

Comment: &gt; Try convincing Linus that some kernel modules should be written in Go or OCaml and see how that goes.  I find that to be a strange emotional response to the presentation of a counterexample that disproves a commonly held belief.  &gt; That link has a really really bad example  It is another counterexample that disproves a commonly-held belief.  &gt; using this as an argument  There is no argument. Just a counterexample.  &gt; the OCaml implementation is better because OCaml does memoization  That is simply not true. Neither solution is doing any memoization. You're just dreaming up fantasy objections because you feel emotionally attached to the validity of the original statement because you've heard it repeated so often that you are rejecting its incorrectness.  &gt; The program spends almost 30% of its time in the count function  That cannot account for the OCaml taking 80% less time.  &gt; The test is bogus and doesn't show what it's supposed to show.  This myth has been busted.

Comment: This post is misleading; it's incredibly unlikely the feature will go in without changes (one could say that is an argument for why it should not have been merged yet, also). I would expect it to be delayed past 5.28 due to the response, now.

Ive never wished my shotty had a grip or light (pip boy flashlight works fine), or putting a launcher on my rifle lol  And to reiterate, because its a significant factor, your carry weight will be overloaded.

Comment: I called this last year. Yes he's young, but he is not very good when he is not running play action or some sort of bootleg. When he is forced to play in the pocket, his throws are extremely inaccurate and off target. I was all over social media last year saying that he wasn't ready to lead this team and that we should have kept Romo to help develop Dak. If I were JJ or JG, I would honestly start The Red Rocket (Cooper Rush) the last game and see where he is at just in case we decide to end this Dak Prescott experiment. If he proves to be more polished throwing from the pocket, and I'm sure he is, I would seriously consider making a swap next year. Point blank, Dak is not the QB to take us to the next level.

As for the "teammate" line, I just took that as meaning friend, given the "team" in question is essentially just a group of friends. But I can definitely see where you're coming from there.

Comment: There is a balance between the rewards available from mining, the effort needed to mine a block and the cost of electricity etc needed to do so.  So if the rewards drop, it may no longer be profitable.  But then if fewer people mine, the difficulty will drop.  As a shorter term effect, if the block rate goes down then TX fees will go up.  We already see quite a variation in fees depending on mempool size.  In future it may be that low sat/byte blocks lead to a decrease in block rate until the pool fills up (increasing fees).

Or u can play new characters and money, and then transfer the money to u. There are many ways to farm money if u willing to put in üí∞ into the game. And.. actually u can gt help from ppl in the game, especially from guildmates who willing to help.

Comment: How much should rely on your ear. Just listen carefully and adjust until it sounds right to you. The only limit is distortion, which will happen when the speaker is trying to do something that it mechanically can not.   I was not familiar with the Peace equalizer that you mentioned, so looked it up. When you are experimenting with it to achieve your goal, don't shy away from changing the values manually in the frequency box and the quality (Q) box. It looks like, as with most plug-ins, there are default values, but those are just starting points. Start with the 1/3 octave preset which will give you a good number of standard center frequencies. The Q value is the steepness of the filter that you will apply. For example, if you set the center frequency of one band of the EQ at 160Hz, and reduce it, 160Hz will be the primary frequency that will be reduced but the adjacent frequencies above and below it will also reduce, albeit by lesser amounts the further away from 160 that they are. A higher Q value will have the reduction at the center frequency less affect the adjacent frequencies, as a lower Q value will have the adjacent frequencies follow the center frequency adjustment more broadly. So, Q is not really a factor of sound quality as one might assume; a lower value of Q is not going to degrade the quality of the sound per se. Higher Q values, which set a steeper curve on the filter can tend to sound unnatural at higher gains/reductions, and lower Q values can tend to pull down too many frequencies along with the center frequency creating hollow spots if reduced significantly.  You should also experiment with boosting the lower frequencies that you are trying to bring out (maybe try between 60 and 100 Hz or so), generally with lower Q values, just be careful to not push the speaker beyond its limits and into distortion or damage. Turn it up, experiment, and have fun. Merry Christmas.

To get a hang of the controls and various little things it is a bit overwhelming with all of the different things going on. Once you know what's going on and such though, Germany is pretty good for a starter run through, what with how strong they are early.

Comment: One of the things people may not have liked was the length of the movie; but reading all the replies to your comment, it sounds like people wanted a 10 hour movie.  "What about all the plotlines they didn't follow up on! What about X! what about Y! Where are all these aliens, what about the rest of the galaxy?!"  TFA closed up a lot of its plotlines for one.  And the whole, "what about the rest of the galaxy?" is something that just isn't tied to this movie.  The whole point is that the First Order has located what is left of the Resistance and wants to snuff them out for good.  When the entirety of your movement exists on one ship, they can't really swing to every other part of the galaxy.

Comment: Much as I like and appreciate the original movie, I don't believe it's a sacred enough piece of work that it can't be invoked in a more commercial sense. Live at Pompeii, after all, was made to be sold, empty colosseum or not.   Yeah, playing Pompeii again is something of a gimmick, but it's certainly no more a sell-out than touring The Wall in countless stadiums around the world - something both Gilmour and Waters have now done. I see it as a fun callback. That it's also a great way to sell a DVD doesn't bother me.

DMG files are what make up the IPSW and since iPhone 5/5c dmg are in HFS+ and not APFS like iPhone 5s and above we can deduce iPhone 5/5c doesn't support APFS.

Comment: What do you mean "original New 3DS"? That seems to be contradictory terms in Nintendo's making scheme.  The 25th anniversary Zelda 3DS that came with Ocarina of Time is just a "3DS", as it's the first design you could call it the original  Later came the larger "3DS XL". Then the "New 3DS" and "New 3DS XL" launched years later with new hardware (better face tracking for 3D, c stick, NFC readers, better processors)

Comment: It doesn't seem to be binding but here is the official voting procedure from the BBWAA RULES FOR ELECTION:  &gt;Voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, **integrity**, sportsmanship, **character**, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.  Emphasis mine.   So whether the hall *should* only be about on-field performance is up for debate, but they explicitly say that integrity and character should be a part of the voting process.   I personally think Schilling fails miserably in those regards, but once again, these are non-binding rules so it is just up to the individual voters.

Comment: &gt; I've read that if we were to switch over to 100% nuclear (fission) energy, we would need to commission 3 nuclear plants per week in the world for the next 50 years to successfully replace fossil fuels without a loss of net energy.  Worldwide electrical generation is around [5.7TW](http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/TOP-20-Capacity#tspQvChart) today, although some of that is redundant. Electrifying everything would increase that by a factor of at least 1.5 - for simplicity's stake let's just go with a target of 10 TW.  If by plant you mean reactor and we use a typical value of 1GW. Current capacity is about [400 GW](http://world-nuclear.org/getmedia/b392d1cd-f7d2-4d54-9355-9a65f71a3419/world-nuclear-performance-report-2017.pdf.aspx), so 9.6 TW to go, or 9600 reactors. So yeah, that's about 3.7 a week.  Now if you meant plant - which historically have opened multiple reactors at a time, although they often added more later - then it'd be fewer. I don't really know what the worldwide average number of reactors per plant is, maybe something like 3?  But this also assumes that worldwide energy demand won't go up over the next 50 years, which is probably not true barring huge advances in efficiency and/or big changes in society.  Anyway it's kind of arbitrary since we're talking about a worldwide effort, if the biggest energy consumers built new reactors at the kind of rate France has from around 1970 to 2000 it could be done. I imagine the vast majority of the world's existing electricity generators were also built in the last 50 years.

Ask new company how their process works with specific task. Ask follow up questions if the answer isn't sufficient asking new company to explain X more.  Determine if the answer is satisfactory to you.  You can protect for outright lying, the only thing you can do is ask the same question different ways to different people and determine if the answers are consistence.

Comment: Hmm.  "Excessive curing".  I would have expected the ball to be fully cured before shipping.  But if that's the case waterproofing the rack bars should eliminate the issue.  Or wrapping them in plastic wrap.  Thanks for posting that though.

Compilation times are one of the few things where I can throw money at it and it actually helps.  At least for our code base. Your results may vary of course.

The correct format is:        **Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text      Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?      Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.

The people from adafruit highly praise it.  On the other hand I find strange that with so many huge electronic parts companies that they haven't created an online "open source" version of something like it. I know they are many good sites but I haven't found one as organized and well finished as the mentioned books.

The problem i‚Äôm seeing is that you are using neither yan or narlax, the two newest and strongest champions.   (As a side note, my previous best using mayben, helios and efrigid was 17:51. That was with multiple meteors.)  I‚Äôm currently in the top score slot for my platinum group and I honestly can‚Äôt even imagine how you could compete without the two newest champions. Just cave and buy them, or wait till you get lucky and find a group with a bunch people that also don‚Äôt have the two new heroes.

They also have reasons for the returns on the kennel cards, which can tell you if it was behavior or just somebody who couldn't keep their animal (though for the cats that may be slightly less accessible than for the dogs because of the shelter's layout)

Comment: It wasn't dropping legacy console support that increased vault space... That didn't happen until year 3. When the vault space increased, they removed assets from the tower. Two sweeperbots and something else. That opened up the necessary memory.

Comment: Doge hadn't made any major moves in a while, so I took my 30K Doge (originally paid about $15) and flipped it into Ether a few months back.  That's now worth maybe $70. If I had kept it in Doge, I would have about $300, right?  Looks like I missed the first flight to the moon! I've learned my lesson, and am going to invest in it again a few paychecks from now, hopefully it won't have soared too high by then.

Comment: I never played or cared about the Sims, from the outside it looks like it's really just floundering due to rushed and low quality and overproduction of "expansion" content making barrier to entry to a "complete" version of the game prohibitively high.  Might be interesting to get some inspiration or a twist to the formula by taking a few cues from non-sims games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley or the like.

But if he can't use a technique because he doesn't have the required knowledge for it then his power would be useless, even martial art moves are guided by knowledge.

IMHO satoshi was good with cryptography and math stuff but he was not that good with software and hardware. So he could not foresee his initial vision will be destroyed by greedy ASIC miners, otherwise I am sure he would pick ASIC resistant hashing algorithm.

After some wine and champagne everyone was on board for a few rounds. We ended up playing for 3 hours! So much giggling and videos for Snapchat! Really brought my family together for a day. The switch doesn‚Äôt have any hard controls for the game, all you need to do is dance. My dad also really liked Mario kart and learned it in about 5 min and ended up beating me in multiple rounds. No one frowned on it, although they were apprehensive at first we had a blast.

Comment: I've been playing for a long time and my weakness has always been defense because I have always defended manually. The past few weeks I have had to put in a huge mental effort to not defend as manually. I always try to defend with my CDM or CM, not switching to my CBs until I absolutely need to tackle. I use teammate contain in short bursts, because if you start to use it for too long good opponents will recognize and beat the AI. I usually use it when they move play out wide, so I can stay central with my CDM and use 2nd man press to contain with a CM or outside back. I hope this helps, I'm really not amazing at defense haha

People which are born into riches have a much easier time and tend to just want to horde their money and save it to become no more rich so they can say " I was worth 3 million last year! Now I'm worth 6 million". There is only so much of the world's riches you can horde.

Comment: Granted I've been on keto for only two months whenever I've had to cheat it's usually been less than 50 net carbs and I wasn't kicked out. (Thankfully)  Since then any "cheat days" have just been going over my calorie goal. (Rare)  I do recall reading someone on here saying they could go as far as 75 before being kicked out but your mileage may vary. I think I recall a video saying less than 30 net carbs per meal but not too sure about that one.

Comment: Do you have it in writing you told them to close the account? Call them and tell them that‚Äôs what you instructed them to do when you took your money and left. They should clear it up. Having it in writing will make it easier but it should be pretty obvious because you took out all your money what your intention was.

Comment: It has been tested in the past whether or not the starter pikachu would get a hat during an event -- it didn't. It has been theorized that the starters are hardcoded into the client. Not sure if moves would be hardcoded in too or not. Has pikachu had a move change in the past that may have affected the starter in the past.

Comment: To become a citizen of Norway you actually need to live there with a job for like 1 year (of which time you get no government benifits) and take like 400 hours of classroom time to learn the language. There are loads of other restrictions, and also you must revoke any other citizenship, so if you decide to go back home you would have to reapply for citizenship for your original country.

Most of her school friends who wanted to have good jobs but didn't do well on their school results went into vocations that didn't need specialized training that they couldn't get into. So instead they went into nursing school to pursue careers as carers for patients and the elderly.

Comment: Personally I think your going to get more advantage by having approach main, then they spend the rest of the games wondering if it is in or not. Everything else honestly looks very split on the overall plan of the deck. Now that you have it slam it against the meta and you will know what feels bad or what doesnt seems to have enough support.

I've NEVER held an uncomfortable Nintendo or Microsoft control *other* than their very first iterations (Xbox and NA)  All of Sony's controllers are basically like holding sharp corners where you can get jammed up if you have large hands and need to bend the sticks toward each other.

I checked my crossovers and Audessy set the L/R to 40 hz which I didn‚Äôt think was too off since my Paradigms say they reach down to 39 hz (DIN) and my center to 60hz. I will bring those up to 80hz.   I am going to bring the sub level setting up to -8 dB from the -5.5 I have them at and see what it sounds like.   Oh, my LFE is set to LFE and LPF is 120 hz. I should have mentioned that as well.

Comment: You have to move to an area that doesn't have schools pumping out 20-30 x ray techs per year to find a steady (non per diem) job. It gets too saturated when schools are close to hospitals or clinics.  I applied to several hospitals (while I was in my last semester) in different areas I was interested in moving to. Got a job the day I graduated, manly because there's no schools (that have radiology) close to where I work.  Also, if you're just looking for work - check our local urgent cares. You'll do more than just x-ray (registration or ER tech work) but you'll learn a lot and get radiology experience under your belt.

From what little I remember, it was allowed for stuff like allowing playback on devices, though could be more, I stopped at linux.  However, yeah, your whole collection is pushing it. Except for other things that are law, like being able to back up your stuff, etc. It is convoluted, but the end results, from what I remember, was Blurays where done in a way to block all legal backups, that dvds allowed.

When you purchase the expansion the game will preserve separate base game versions of any characters you bring into the expansion, frozen at the moment you installed the xpac. These are what you will load up if you uninstall the xpac.

Comment: there is no meat in cigkofte in Turkey since many years,  the ingredients are bulgur tomato paste and spices mostly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Qwujm13Dg check out other videos as well the ingredients may vary.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/√áiƒü_k√∂fte  "Although traditional recipe requires minced -raw- meat, the version in Turkey consumed as fast-food (through small franchise shops in every neighborhood of Turkey) must be meatless by law due to hygienic necessities.[8] Therefore, √ßiƒü k√∂fte is, unless restaurant or home-made, vegan in Turkey. Meat is replaced by ground walnuts, hazelnuts and potato.[9][10][11]"

I've also seen schools in 3rd world shitholes where people actually made something of themselves, and those schools were far worse than anything you have in the US.  &gt;And why are the schools so awful?  Not the schools, it's the people. And parenting is an issue, don't put it all on the teachers.

Comment: He was stuck at 8 points in my league for almost 2.5 quarters and I essentially gave up. After another 20 minutes of Christmas Vacation funnies I begrudgingly refreshed Yahoo and he had 25 suddenly. Because of bonus points he ended up with 32 in my league and I honestly thought there had been a mistake. Going with Bortles post-Wentzylmania  was a huge risk and a big reward so far, same with flexing Cole this week. Just gotta hang on through one more game tomorrow.

There were so many old nazis in different positions of power (Hans Filbinger for example) way into the Bundesrepublik that you can't just declare someone innocent who was active in that regime. The mentioned Rall was part of the Unternehmen Barbarossa, so I doubt he really was innocent.

So you're wrong there.  &gt;Your argument seems to be that this is the only supplemental/backup distribution battery system installation capable of such a response  Yes, because it's THE LARGEST BATTERY BANK OF IT'S KIND IN THE WORLD, making no other battery bank capable of delivering this kind of power.

Comment: Using my pro controller right now and it‚Äôs a fantastic bit of kit. I get hand cramps off my PS4 if I play for a few hours and the battery life is absolutely abysmal. I can play all day long on my pro controller and the battery is astounding, for me the switch pro controller is the best current gen controller hands down

Comment: If these where reasonable pensions I could agree with you, but they are insanely high.  The only reason anyone ever agreed to them is because whatever bureaucrat was in charge of making the promise knew he would be long gone once it came time to pay for all of this.  There is no way that even under the best of circumstances anyone could have payed these pensions, most of these workers will functionally be getting a raise once they retire.

The two 1v1 games I play the most are Pokemon VGC and Hearthstone and both only really infuriate me when RNG is involved. The only other thing that gets in more nerves is when my opponents utilize annoying strategies that are designed to just be annoying.

Comment: Publix hasn't made any public statement one way or another on where tax cuts savings will be spent.   **Most** companies are not doing either one time, or increase dividend adjustments.  Instead, it's much more likely Publix will issue a stock buy back program. Which will increase the value of shares you hold.  That's an easy, red tape free way of increasing shareholder value for any company. So that is what I would ultimately expect.

Comment: Current autoland systems require a radar altimeter, which detects your distance from the ground using a radar mounted in the nose of the plane. So setting altitude to zero would actually work in this case.

Comment: I would say forge cleric since if you don't have magical crossbow yet would still come in handy. (the game doesn't seem to like to hand out magic xbows for some reason) and some of the spells at early cleric levels are always handy to have around, bless, healing word sanctuary.    How ever here I am wondering if your better off staying a fighter, at level 12 you get another ASI which you could also throw on another feat, the divine strike comes online at cleric level 8, which if you start at 12 would be level 20. Most dips into cleric usually are to pick up medium armor, shields and some healing.

You should NEVER be using an open wifi network for important stuff or share your private one with people you dont trust. Theres a reason why GUEST networks exist.

Comment: Wow what a great read... thank you! My next question is if the average starting salary for my job is pre-tax income of $1,500 for 40 hours of work = $37.5/hr. So knowing that this job offers no benefits (including 401k) what is the starting hourly rate that would be the bare minimum to take.....  Once I figure the minimum hourly rate I should be taking due to no benefits, than I can have a negotiating start point...   So if the minimum hourly rate that is worth ith no benefits is $45/hr, now I can say I'd like $55 with a 1099 or $50 with a W-2? Am I understand this correctly?

Comment: &gt;. Or even better, tell your bank you want a new replacement card. The new card would usually have a new CVV code meaning old card ideally shouldn't work once the new one is activated.    If the company can prove OP consented to pre-authorized payments (which will be in the terms of service when they signed up) the bank can forward the payment requests to the new card.

Comment: You can play the game like most of us are and still be vocal about the issues this game has, for me mainly being end game stuff and the overall expansion of lootboxes/Eververse from stuff we used to be able to get in regular activities not Bright Engrams. Just overall seems like a de-evolution from Destiny 1 and expansion of the Eververse.

Comment: Nah, I just mean, Empire got not stellar reviews when it came out from critics and audiences alike but it's reputation grew over the following decade or so. I think some people expect the same will happen with TLJ, but, I just think that way the internet proliferates opinions means that consensus' are formed far quicker than pre-internet when reviews took a long time to disseminate and for audiences to share their opinions. So, while I think say, an old Michael Cinimo movie can get a re-evaluation long after it's release, it's far less likely for a film released in modern times to get re-evaluated as an overlooked or misunderstood gem given the massive volume of reviews and discussion that happens within months of the release.

Comment: I don't think it's a mediocre movie but I do think it's a mediocre starwars movie. The story you speak of I find shallow and empty. I see no motivation for Kylo's decisions, I see no reason for Rey's determination. I see no world building or explanation of setting. I know little of the state of the galaxy besides that the First Order is in charge. I have learned almost nothing of the starwars universe.  This would all be fine for a normal Hollywood flick, but this is starwars, and there is a massive amount of lore to go off of. No longer. This isn't a deep universe with rich lore anymore.

The whole point of an orb fest is that you can mindlessly farm orbs, money and exp non stop and refresh your stamina whenever you run out.  With the introduction of tickets, you will be probably limited to like 1 run per ticket or something.

We played a terrible, sloppy game, and we boatraced UNC by 20.   ASU has played awesome this year. I get why you're excited about that. But these advanced ranking systems aren't out to get ya. There isn't a variable in the algorithm for all of these databases that gives a team negative points for being named "Arizona State." ASU just hasn't been quite as good as some other teams.

Comment: When you play with lower skill people they aren't effective at early farming, I have played with am and other similar people and even with them in lane I end up with bf sooner and avoid taking farm away from them once they start hitting the jungle with it.  I'm not saying my build is better than the one you describe, but when I used to run that I end up losing more than this bf build.  It's just easy to farm jungle with the skeletons early on when your heavy carry is in lane.

Comment: I could be mistaken, but I thought I read somewhere about their being a problem with Multiclassing.  Like you could lose some of the Monk features, for example Unarmored Defense.  Is this something that has some truth behind it or did I just misread/mistaken something?  I do know that I could be delayed in getting ASIs because they happen as class level and not total level, but I thought this was more of a problem which could break the Monk side of my character in a bad way.

Comment: &gt;That being said, I cannot (and would rather not) play every power level mission, and on top of that it'd be really hard for me to get every tier of chest.  That's from my post. Do you realize how difficult it is to get every tier chest (there's 6) on every PL mission? And I'd have to fail each PL too.  I don't know how many different Power Level missions they offer, since I don't even have twine unlocked, but lets say there's 20.  20 * 7 = 140. I'd have to run 140 individual missions. That's assuming I could get the exact tier chest I want every time. Okay now even if these took 5 minutes each, that's 700 minutes.  This is why I'm asking people to take 10-30 seconds after a mission to fill out the form.

Comment: Read what you like! Women love men with interests, and it will be easy to talk to fellow readers about things you're interested in.  Into sci-fi? Some ladies are too! That will spark much better interactions than trying to read something you think they like.  That being said, if you're still looking for advice, books about the female experience can help you grow as a person. I recommend Lean In as a start on women working in male dominated environments.

Comment: Also I side note if you realize you're getting counter hit a lot it probably means you should chill out and block because your opponent's pressure is too much for you to mash out of.  On the other hand if you're landing a lot of counter hits you know your opponent isn't respecting your pressure and you can set them up and bait them for some really damaging counter hit punish combos

I still do not know any of the talents until I'm actually in the game. Now they add new items and such and I just don't really want to relearn the game, it's a totally different game than when I was into it.

Comment: Since the canary went out, with the new installer and all. Both version work very slow to me. I uninstalled and reinstall my amd drivers all over again and nothing. Yes, i notice improvementes in the load speed because of the recently update, but once in game Example: Ocarina of time: Now its slow, which of course before this was working flawesly together with Majoras  and all Zeldas. I supposse i must wait they can improve this versions. Of course its my experience.

And the "ghostwriter" is Quentin Miller, who is credited on the song so not a ghostwriter. It's ghostwriting when the writer is paid to receive no credit. Miller wrote on several songs on that album.

Comment: Except it still solves the problem. People go to the doctor much more when it's free, which provides hospitals a lot more money to cover wages and costs. Having not-for-profit institutions and social healthcare is a much better and more efficient system. The NHS is a great example of how well it can work.

I wake up on days off always at the same time even if I have nothing planned just to preserve the routine.

Comment: It injected about a billion dollars into the markets which will lead to a much higher rise in market cap. The market cap is not the amount of money that has gone into crypto, market cap is just the total value as of right now. The money that went in is actually much smaller. With the market as crazy as it is, $1 billion going in could give you as much as an extra $100 billion in marketcap.  But in actual use, things like wash trading were used using the Tethers. This is where you create fake demand for a security by trading it back and forth between bots.

Comment: I found it interesting,  for sure.  It's got a good UI / presentation. The knowledge requirement is very high of course because of the 140 champs and several items which all have different spells.  But the game plays very smoothly,  with good controls,  and the item shop is very easy to use even for new players. I only played a couple of bot games,  so I'm really just unfamiliar with 99% of the game,  but i had some fun.   I would recommend to try it,  if you have the time, and want to see a different game other than HOTS. Want to emphasize on time investment because theres a looot of variables when building a champ or a draft.

Comment: It's not necessarily because of less sleep, but most likely that you woke up in the end of a sleep cycle and not in the middle of a REM cycle. A sleep cycle is about 90 minutes, and if you sleep for 6-7 hours a night is good for about 3 sleep cycles. When you wake up 30 minutes before or after a sleep cycle you feel pretty rested. So if you wake up at the end of 2-2.5 sleep hours (3-3.5 hours) you feel rested because you are at the end of a sleep cycle.   Source: As someone who sleeps for about 5-7 hours a night, I know from experience.

The fact that you ownan Arsenal shirt is plenty.  \&gt;If you're sitting with the away fans, you *have* to almost pretend to be one. In this case, do not wear any club colours, do not celebrate goals or complain at theirs. If someone asks you why you're quiet &amp; not celebrating an away team goal then by all means answer honestly, you're not going to get a kicking for supporting the other team (unless you're sitting with Millwall fans); it's just about being respectful and remembering that for those couple of hours, you are in *their* territory.  Other than that, enjoy the game!

Comment: I was thinking the same thing. Might give my Dad some NEO. I tried telling him about crypto when btc were still at $400 and he said I was out my mind. Figured I should buy one for him and leave it but I never did so now I think I can get a second chance with NEO. Maybe the best way to convince your closer family might be just to buy it for them. Eventually they will be telling all the people they know too so its supporting the cause too.

Comment: It depends how much they're talking. I talk to this girl I met online almost everyday. We mostly just talk about video games we play, but I don't really know her, we just have things in common. I have no interest in her, I don't even know what she looks like. But if I was in a relationship and they tried to get me to stop talking to her, I'd be pretty annoyed because she's my friend. That being said, I talk to her in my free time, not when I'm with friends or something like that. If your girlfriend is constantly texting him, you might want to tell her it's getting in the way of things. If she's talking to him rather than you, then that's an issue.

Comment: It essentially was just a tech demo. It was used as the primary means of demonstrating what a switch is capable of, and was also used as a way for Nintendo to test vario systems that we can only assume will be used in later installments of the open world Zelda games, but was by no means a complete game at least in my eyes. It was through and through intended to just be a test to show off the console and little system tests for open world Zelda.   You may find it a ridiculous accusation, but it's really not that far out from the truth.

Comment: We were just going to pay people in coins and if they want to exchange they can. My question with that is, is there a way to automate the coins into everyone's wallet or do we just manually do it periodically.   Yes I've heard that we have tax exposure at market value when the coin is mined and then if the coin is used or sold later you pay capital gains tax as well :/ I think I saw an app somewhere that keeps track of this for tax purposes

Comment: Oh wait, this person is mysterious rather than optimistic seeming.   And when you get to know him, he will have a stern or orderly way about him, and he will like women who are also like this.   He can be flirty, if he doesn't lack confidence, and would most likely meet women through his circles of friends or his networks.

Comment: I (like many others I'm sure) finally started paying attention to crypto this month with Bitcoin's insane surge. I have a few end-of-year $k lying around so I thought it would be fun to get in on the action. At first I just bought a couple hundred dollars' worth of BTC and ETH on Coinbase, but a little more in-depth research and thought led me to XRP and I couldn't be more stoked to be here. Excited to get in at $1 and to see how 2018 unfolds with all you beautiful souls!

Comment: The key for these classes, especially calc 2, is to not wait to review the material until the exams. Took these both last spring, and the exams were always within a day of each other, with a data project due around the same time. Actually doing the calc textbook problems when they're assigned will go a long way come exam time. For data, the biggest that helped my grade was joining a study group. It reinforces the material and allows you to meet people who you can work on assignments with.

Comment: Alright definitely misunderstanding. I was trying to asking (after getting Storm's Eye) whether spamming Butcher's Block combo(20 more combo potency) or Storm's Path(10 more gauge) is better. Talking with you/others on this list it seems later is better.   As BRD main the extra buttons isn't an issue,though I guess being that when I OT I never seen MT have aggro issues besides during boss swaps. Combine this with people talking like this is the norm when atleast for me with pugs even with statics I rarely see MT stay in DPS so I guess it feels like a non-issue since they always have more aggro? Though today helped me understand that dps MT is viable and then in those circumstances spam shirking would be reasonable. Honestly until this thread I didn't know this was expected in the HC scene since I consider myself MC.

Comment: Yes many aboriginal populations were deprived of land an likely deserve some restitution.  Not all ways to acquire land listed by Earle were necessarily moral.  Your concern about fencing of land when someone else had already established a pattern of use on it is legitimate. One way to address this is to recognize patterns of use as establishing an easement.

Comment: I'll consider dropping the Wardrobes to 2 since the aggro games I'm up against pretty much necessitate some swing evo if I'm going second. But Fangblade... I hadn't heard that suggested to me for any purpose in a long while. I thought about Carabosse time to time but I only have the one copy of it. Might make more but I'm kind of hesitant to plink down that much instead of just for like a set of golds due to expansion and likely needing to filch for Portal. But good suggestions. Maybe emeralda might be of use.

Comment: It comes from the Russian programming genius Sheiko. Basically, it is set up that particular way to get volume. Volume gives hypertrophy but is also set up to promote strength with the intensity being high.  Set up in the way that you can get more weight and volume than doing 5x10 (with all the sets the same weight).    That would be fine if it fits your goals  Are you asking if enough leg work with just the compounds?  If that is your question, I‚Äôd say minimum do a hamstring accessory as it‚Äôll prevent APT and any imbalances from being too quad dominant.

He played a good game today against the Browns and everyone just threw out all of the negative that's happened this season like the missed tackles and struggles against guys like Marquise Goodwin and TJ Jones as well as how he missed all of last year. I want to see Amukamara and Fuller come back but if he wants   a monster deal, I'd rather go after someone who's worth it like Trumaine Johnson.

Comment: In a free market, if the customer is not well served by one enterprise, they are free to patronize another. This allows both the vender and the individual to conduct their affairs freely as they see fit.  If the vendor acts in such a way as to offend their customer base, they will ultimately lose revenue, and go out of service to companies which better serve those same clients.  It‚Äôs a Darwinian solution which allows for the market to evolve over time to better meet the needs of the population they serve.

Now unlike sports, it's very easy to run your mouth and flame a team mate for making a mistake when you're not face to face with your team mates. People forget the human often.    If someone is being toxic, mute them, no second chances, first sign of toxicity, mute them on the scoreboard. If necessary file a report post game outlining the extent of their toxicity.   It's a game, have fun with it.

Comment: Depends on where you apply the saying.  Money buys you comfort and makes your life more stress free. Having to worry about being poor and to do things like supporting a family the way you want to, obviously is going to overpower happiness.  But I think after a point, more money doesn't make you happier. It only makes you happier to the point where it releases you from worrying about money. Where you don't worry about where the money to pay for things is coming from. After that, having more kinda really plateaus way off.

Comment: It's not really about your DPI but your eDPI (DPI * in game sens).  If you have a high end mouse it can probably handle even it's highest DPI during normal use, but it might encounter problems if you're constantly moving your mouse at very high speeds (which you probably wont be doing). In any case you dont need a DPI that high unless you have really high resolution (like 8k) or really high in game sens (in which case you wont want that high DPI anyway).  If you have a normal 1920x1080 monitor 600-1000 DPI is gonna be perfectly fine and you're not gonna feel an improvement with higher DPI - it's probably not gonna be a bother either tho. You can see [here](https://prosettings.net/overwatch-pro-settings-gear-list/) what pro players are using in terms of sensitivities. Hitscan players like surefour and akm usually use eDPI's of 3000-6000 - so if your DPI is 3200 you'd be better off with an ingame sens something like 1.5.  You have to spend some time getting used to your new sens setting, but in the end it will very likely improve your aim. Having a high sensitivity makes it difficult if not impossible to make precise aim adjustments. Try seing how far your aim moves if you move your mouse the smallest possible distance - if it moves farther than the width of lucios head at 50m then you can NEVER reliably hit a lucio at 50m literally no matter how good your aim is.

I left my old company because I had some issues with their management decisions, but I gave 3 weeks notice because my job was very specific and I was the only one who did it, so I had to train another person on it. That's part of the reason why I left, because I was so good at my position it was easier for them to just keep me there forever than it was to move me up in the company. I still liked the people I worked with, though; it wasn't their fault my manager was the douchiest of all bags.

Comment: Are you familiar with r/OverwatchUniversity ? I recommend it highly. If you are capable of playing some comp games and recording maybe 1 or two. The folks over at OU are great at analyzing game footage and helping point out mistakes, where you could improve and critiquing hero/game styles.   I‚Äôve moved from plat to masters. Once I had others review my game footage and call me out on my bad habits or things I THOUGHT were smart plays but may have left my team vulnerable.  An outside perspective is the best place to start! If you‚Äôre on PC look up shadowplay to start recording some gameplay. If you‚Äôre on console the systems should have built in game DVRs.   So my advice is check out OU after you‚Äôve got some games recorded. Make apost let those folks know your rank, the hero‚Äôs you play and maybe some things you‚Äôve been struggling with.

Comment: If you could do a Masters instead of a BA, that'd actually make more sense.  A Masters is cheaper and people like that better than a BA when they're hiring.  Masters programs are usually designed with the expectation that you'll work while doing the degree too.  I have a friend who went from a BA in econ, BS in Biology, to a Masters in computer science, and he got a full time job in programming like a year before he graduated.  And he had a part-time job before that.

Comment: So what happened is someone bought a GTX 1080 on Newegg, took the card and put their old 960 AMP in the box returned it, and now you ended up with it when they resold it. Newegg warehouse employees are paid nothing and don't know anything about graphics cards, it looked fine so it was resold.  You need to get in contact with Newegg ASAP and get it returned for a refund/replacement.

Comment: Anyone's answers on here will be completely arbitrary. Look up average GPA and SAT for Pitt admits into the program you want (my high school provided this for me, maybe yours does the same?) and if yours look to be about the same, give yourself a decent shot of getting in. In the end it will be random but if you have a good essay and application you will be slightly more likely to get in.  Sorry for the lack of help but no one here will be able to say "you are xx% likely to get in". I had friends with better GPA and SAT scores than me not get in when I did. Your scores and GPA look pretty high though so I'd say from those you'd have a decent shot but then again I'm just a student I know nothing about admissions.

Comment: ?  Brady could have declined this year, no need to franchise Jimmy yet.  If Brady declines/gets a serious injury this season, we have Jimmy and probably franchise him this offseason.    Are you saying we should have kept Jimmy, then franchised him, then traded him under the tag if we didn't want to move on from Brady?  I'm not sure we'd get value back from that move, because JG still would only have 6 quarters of ever-older game tape on him.

Comment: #Real answer:  Spending the spring semester joining a fraternity will take up a significant amount of your time (treat it like adding 3-4 extra credits to your schedule). Your grades indicate you have probably had some issues adjusting to the academics at college and you should put your full efforts into classes, that is what you pay to be here for. Some fraternities will do Fall semester rush classes for sophomores and you can still rush as a sophomore in the spring.   # Alternate answer:   &gt;&gt; Do they even care lol?  The University cares, as in you cannot register for rush if you're outside the GPA cutoff. That being said, if the brothers at a fraternity like you and want you to join, they will find a way for you to ghost pledge without the school knowing and add to you to the school's roster at a later date.   Take this information as you will, but put some serious though about what your short and long term goals are at Hopkins and where academics vs fraternity life fit into those goals. To your comment in this thread:  &gt;&gt;what's the lowest gpa you've heard of at hopkins? how many people are in my boat or do worse?  I can't say, for certain, but a 1.71 is NOT good and will honestly hurt your GPA for the rest of college. I don't know what your goals are (med school or grad school) but you will need to have very strong academic performance for the next 7 semesters to deal with this and come out ahead

Comment: I hate to be "that guy" but the vast majority of ammo devices available in Star Citizen will be magazines, not clips.  Clips hold the cartridges until placed in an internal magazine that usually isn't removable. The magazine holds the cartridges and feeds them into the firearm. Clips are still used for a few older firearms (to my knowledge, anyway), while most modern firearms just have a detachable magazine that you load ammo directly into, then load the detachable magazine into the firearm.  Not raging, just putting the info out there should you or others want to know.

Comment: It's not exactly a given like you're implying. All of our major players are playing considerably worse without Curry. That didn't happen when Durant went out. Doesn't happen when Klay sits out. When Blake went down after punching his friend, CP and DeAndre's numbers both spiked.  It's a given that Curry makes the team better. But  a lot of times you don't see this kind of statistical slump from the whole team.

Comment: Are you looking straight up when you're trying to long jump? I noticed the change on the first day, but now all you need to do is look straight ahead and you'll get the same amount of distance as looking up pre-patch.

Comment: 2 weeks is nothing compared to Atom. His full gameplay trailer came out only 6 days before he launched. Granted, he had already technically been revealed in October, but still.  With that precedent set, we should have an Enchantress trailer by next Wednesday, which is a real possibility if whoever decides when to post the trailers decides to take the rest of the month off.

Comment: Those are definitely dealbreaker qualities in a partner, but i‚Äôve only seen versions of the first 4 referenced as high maintenance in my own life. And the variation of that ranged all the way down to like, me being called high maintenance by a boyfriend‚Äôs roommate because I wanted to make weekend plans before Wednesday. Because I lived an hour away and also had a life and friends and if we weren‚Äôt gonna go on a date I wanted to be able to plan other stuff.  With your list it sounds like high maintenance is a catch-all for an overly demanding or manipulative person?

Comment: The real meat of the story here is how much land ownership by the wealthy has increased in the last 10 years.  People are looking for solid investments outside of the stock market and I don't blame them considering what the recession did.    But all anyone wants to talk about is income inequality.  The people buying this land are rich already and land has always been an investment for the rich.

Comment: Actually, whether or not it's time-and-a-half, etc., is regulated at the state level.  Some states do, some don't.  Same with break laws.  Example: California requires in a 8-hour day that you get two 10 minute paid rest breaks and one unpaid 30 minute lunch.  But Hawai'i requires only one 10 minute rest break for the same 8-hour day -- and that, only if you are a minor.

Comment: Gaia was not responsible for the creation of the clone zygote.  The Alpha Protocol zygote had been created and were in storage before Gaia was functionally complete.  Brochard-Kline stresses that "Under my watch, our activities and initiatives [at Eleuthia] will comply with the 2034 Clone Provisions and the 2048 Raleigh Accords."  So a degree of genetic drift may have been a requirement as far as Brochard-Kline is concerned.   Alternatively, it may simply be a product of the cloning process that might be explained by [copy-number variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation) - a type of genetic deviation found even among [identical twins](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/identical-twins-genes-are-not-identical/#).

Comment: Dunno about Slowcore feeling like a warm blanket as much as accentuating more depressing feelings, even with its moments of beauty. I wouldn't call it mood music, though its starkness does fit well for winter, as opposed to more festive times.   I generally *like* slowcore as far as liking Low, but I don't have that much interest in the rest of the genre, even if what I've heard isn't especially bad. It's one of those genres where once you've heard the principle players, there's not much to offer from the relatively smaller bands and it's something that gets samey very quickly. Low changed things up a bit as they went (with their last few being radically different from the previous album), so they're the only ones who have really kept my interest. I generally like Red House Painters, but they're a bit too singer-songwriter for me.

There are two visible straps and there probably is at least one more. Also the only times the wheelchair would fly backwards would be if someone rammed into you at extremely high speeds from behind, or if you reverse at high speeds at hit something, neither of which are likely to happen

Comment: I am a great big outspoken fan of singular they. He/she or s/he makes for clunky language, and singular they is understandable. I'd write around it if it was going to cause actual confusion, but mostly it's clear. Singular they was good enough for Shakespeare and was removed by a style guide - in other words by prescriptivists who said 'this isn't proper writing for our publications'. I'll be glad when people stop jumping on it.  Given above, though it's not properly a word. Carunculated, wrinkled like a walnut, from caruncle, a bird's wattle like on a turkey. I fell in love with this word I found in a book and then it turned out to not be 'real'. So I'm all alone with it. I still really like it though.  If I have to pick another, then 'joy'. Hard to think about that word and not feel at least an echo of it.  For research on English ... David Crystal loves the English language and writes about it in a wonderfully absorbing way. I don't study formally so much as just read lots and lots and learn about words and their origins and synonyms. Science fiction pulls in as many obscure words as high brow literature, but for real wordiness you can't beat the 19th century writers who were trying to impress one another with their classical education.

If you read the comment PMacDiggity was making   &gt; there are distressed areas that have low occupancy already, that will probably result in buildings becoming abandoned by landlords as they did in the 70s...   and I was further adding to that comment.  And NYC is more than just Soho and West Village - It also includes Chinatown, LES, Areas of Midtown, Alphabet City, Upper Manhattan in general - and yes, even BedSty, Bushwick, and the rest of the boroughs.  Store front rents going up faster than can be supported by local business (or really businesses in general - heck; rents in general really) is a common problem across all the neighborhoods, but it'll take a lot more than just making the product cheap enough to encourage people to travel there.

But the bottom of the device is obviously metal so it‚Äôs probably going to be ok tapping into things. It‚Äôs the knobs and pads you want to protect.

The ‚Äúshort fuse with the kids‚Äù thing is a bit worrying if they‚Äôre gonna be left with her if you go? Would she hurt them?

Comment: Could you take a pic of the receiver and barrel extension mating point.  It looks like the round is nose diving where it hits the feed ramp.  Almost like you have an m4 cut upper receiver with a rifle extension which is unlikely.    Does it feed with 29rds in a mag?  If so i would check the alignment of the barrel extension since that would be from the other side...  i would do this before replacing buffer springs, heavy buffer springs solve some issues but cause others, you may then have trouble with cycling 223 loads

Comment: Who is teaching that men are evil or white people are evil?  You obviously never went to college or university.  So you have no evidence to back up your claims.  Got it.  People in all degree programs are required to take humanities classes as well as science and math classes.  It is required because we believe in giving people a well rounded education.  Do you believe that someone who is pursuing a philosophy degree and is forced to take a math and science class is now being indoctrinated into atheism?    Please try and understand you don't get a job in a degree, you get it in a field or industry.  And many people don't get jobs in the fields or industries they studied.  And the 80s were great but they were the beginning of the avalanche that is destroying the country.    When AI and computer programs can do the math it will become easier to automate whole departments.  The medical field is pretty well insulated against automation but not deregulation.  It is obvious you have no critical thinking skills so please stop.

Comment: If you want to make yourself an idea about how IOTA works, do not let others think for you, go to www.mineiota.com   (https://github.com/janfiedler/mineiota/) and earn IOTAS by mining moneros from your browser, without installing anything in a controlled   environment. It is safe. You will not get rich but that is not the goal, the goal in trying IOTA without paying anything. The only thing they   ask for is an IOTA address (wallet iota addres). I recommend that you first go through https://iotasupport.com/how-addresses-are-used-  in-IOTA.shtml to learn how IOTA adress work and use the node http://node05.iotatoken.nl:16265 in the wallet. Once you have your iotas   send them to your wallet. Remember that IOTA has 0 fees. Do not worry about transfer them as many times as you want, crate several   SEEDs (wallets) and play, try and give your opinion, it's free. If after this, you like IOTA and you have doubts about the project, I'll just tell   you one thing, at this moment BOSCH is hodling IOTAS ( http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/robert-bosch-venture-capital-   makes-first-investment-in-distributed-ledger-technology-137411.html ) ;-)

You did the right thing by leaving. Usually these men realize at some point that having an ice wife wasn‚Äôt worth the destruction of their home life. Reality ceases to exist down there and it‚Äôs easy for people to forget that a year on the ice isn‚Äôt real life.

Comment: Rule #1 for a non-armored character is to keep your wrist irons that you started with: they are the only non-armored hands in the game and you'll need them to achieve a full set of enchanted gear with 100% spell effectiveness. 100% spell effectiveness is uber important for a pure mage build because the game heavily caps certain spell effects at &lt;100% (you can read about it on the UESP). If you accidentally got rid of your wrist irons, I believe there is a second pair in the shivering isles.  The only quest rewards in the game I can think of that aren't leveled are the Jewel of the Rumare from Go Fish and Daedric artifacts. You're going to need a mod that updates your leveled items like AULIAS, or else you'll need to wait until level 30 to do the mages guild for spelldrinker. With AULIAS you can do any content in the game at any level without missing out on the most powerful versions of items. Starting out you can do the mages guild for some willpower robes and a staff, or you can do the main quest and enchant clothing with +magicka sigil stones. Hope this helps.

Make it cost the full cost again to reforge it (as in, the cost it would have cost to forge it from what it was prior to the overclick) so it feels balanced.  That way an accidental overclick only costs you another 2 Plat or whatever to reforge to where it belonged instead of 2000.

They were not as bad as their record indicated, and Jimmy G gives them more than enough to push them over that edge. If Jimmy was QB from the start, there‚Äôs no reason to think they wouldn‚Äôt have won at least 3 of those 5. Next year I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be a playoff team.

Comment: The NYtimes is unusually short too. It's weird.  I don't know. They are usually really "consumer orientated" which I would argue makes their reviews really boring.   I mean I get why bright only gets four paragraphs.  What is there to say really. It's so derivative.  It's a Frankenstein of buddy cop and fantasy stuff.  But a consumer orientated review can't really mention that because of general audiences apparently don't care if they get the same movies over and over. So there is nothing left to say.  Tbh I really hated the movie. I also thought it looked like the dumbest thing from the promotional material.

Keep it under $50 or so and we'll be golden.   When you're ready to check out, PM me the total and I'll send you a gift card to cover the full amount.

Comment: Bitcoin can pretty much co-opt any altcoin innovation, and that makes altcoins irrelevant in the future. Privacy coins like monero for example will become obsolete when bitcoin adopts it‚Äôs own anonymity implementation.     One thing that altcoins can‚Äôt do is prove that it‚Äôs more secure than bitcoin simply because bitcoin has an 8 year running time.  How else can you prove security other than running time?  For majority of life savings and hedge funds, it‚Äôs bitcoin.  So if an alt can provide faster transaction and cheaper fees than bitcoin, then maybe it could play a role as you say.   That is if lightning network and rootstock fails.  We will have to wait and see.

I don't have rocket league so I don't know if the company has any way to contact them. but if you have your switch dock connected by Ethernet try unplugging it and using WiFi.

If someone goes arguing that it "can't" be racism because it's not a race they are discussing, then *nothing* is racism.   The point of racism is identification of certain groups, and attributing them with certain qualities. While there is no such group, it's a social construct indeed.

Comment: Your brew is probably taking too long. Grind more coarse. For what it‚Äôs worth, if you‚Äôre brewing a light natural process, hand grinders can struggle. My Helor has issues with those because the beans are so hard, dense, and full of moisture, it leads to a lot of fines that clog up the brew. Sifting will help A LOT in this case.

Comment: I can't find any information on it, so I just have to trust you. But every 2000 km seems excessive. A good semi-synthetic oil should last at least 5000-10.000 km. But okay, as you say it doesn't take much oil. I will say that you can skip changing the oil filter that often and don't worry if you go over 2000 km though.   Besides that, just ride the motorcycle and keep it relatively good. It's a Honda, they can take it.

Comment: Yea, but you can't look at it that way. There's always going to be a better deal somewhere. What's important is that you're happy with it at the price you paid. And there's no way to know what deals might come up next month, etc.   Which version do you have? How long  have you had it?  I'm sure it's quite a step up coming from a cheap acer laptop. I think my frame of reference is going to be fairly similar. The last laptop I owned was a Dell Inspiron 1500 series(close to 10 years old now) and I have a cheap Lenovo ThinkPad from work which is really unimpressive.   I'm quite sure the exterior build quality will be more then satisfying to me, what worries me is the interior build quality. So many people have had to RMA their devices that I'm worried about ordering such an expensive piece of gear and then having to send it back over and over again.   At this point I'm just waiting to see what kind of sale they have on their website tomorrow(boxing day).

He singlehandedly saved my season, and though I‚Äôve had better players on my team, he quickly became my favorite player in the league. I know his success is related to Kamara, but I‚Äôll be damned if Mark Ingram isn‚Äôt an incredible football player.

Comment: I've yet to buy a single loot box, and i don't play that often, but i have legendary skins for everyone. I also have enough in game currency saved to buy anything i could want. Its really easy to earn loot boxes in game, and they keep it to cosmetics, so i don't see the harm. It also keeps the developers motivated to release new heroes, skins, and balance patches. A game that needs continued support needs a constant flow of income, and i feel Overwatch does it pretty perfectly.

Without the walls you have all kinds of room, but you're more exposed.

I wanted to pay more attention to the Ivy League so I decided to rep them. I've always liked Dartmouth because my late uncle went there and played for them.  Edit: I actually attend WashU part time right now, which would be my secondary flair otherwise, but is not as I do not care about their football team in the slightest, and neither does their football team, it seems.

Comment: There is a theory that the mutation for lactose tolerance sprung up in places where people were already making primitive cheese/yogurt. In times of famine, they would be tempted to eat the product "before it was done" and those with the mutation had a big survival advantage since they could digest it better.

Comment: This comes from a plat 2 scrub but i think OPs biggest problem is because he doesn't think "why" he does stuff. He just builds what probuilds tells him to.  He should analyse his games, how long they last etc etc and then compare what he builds. Gathering storm for example is pretty subpar. It sounds like great rune but after realising how it scales, it isnt that great. Paging /u/Alpharen

Comment: &gt; Just replace "kind" with "monophyletic group" -- it's an exact match for what Genesis says, even if not for what creationists think Genesis ought to say.  It is NOT.  First of all it is *hardly used* by creationist as "monophyletic group". It is MAINLY used as an synonym of "species", "genera", "family", "tribe", "order" even for "class", randomly, shifting the meaning even within a few sentences, at their whim, serving purposes of confusion, goal post shifting and twisting and turning whatever they need to make their case.  Secondly, a monophyletic group is a group of organisms that forms a clade, which consists of all the descendants of a common ancestor. That *directly* opposes the creationist notion of common design, 6,000 years ago, all known species simultaneously emerging during creation. Creationists oppose common ancestry. Thus they CAN'T use their superfluous concept of "kind" as a version of monophyly.

Comment: My bias goes to option 3. I view a degree as nothing more than a mildly successful guarantee that I know how to write code. If you can show, through other means, that you're perfectly capable of writing code, then you don't really need a degree. Some places will disagree with this sentiment, but when looking at candidates, it's far more appealing to hire the person with a few side projects on their GitHub over the person that just has a college degree.

Comment: It would be nice. I think it's clear that they designed the game with a HOTAS in mind, so didn't put as much effort into the default kb/m controls. The customisation options are great though, so if you put in a little effort to set it up yourself you can have it work however you want. Before I got a HOTAS, I had throttle on the mouse wheel (freeing up W+S for vertical thrust), roll on A+D, yaw on mouse x-axis, pitch inverted, and distributor control as SPACE+W/A/S/D for quick access during fights.   Make sure relative mouse control (or something similar, I forget the exact name) is turned on for each mouse axis. Also, by default, you only have one key bound for using your FSD. It's better to unbind this and set up the two separate bindings (unbound by default) for hyperspace jump and supercruise. There are some other useful things that are unbound by default, such as resuming route (for if you target something else part way through a multiple jump trip and want to continue). Setting a binding for 75% throttle can be helpful for approaching stations in supercruise.

Comment: Paying attention to the things that interest you, and excelling at them? Not forcing yourself to pay attention to things that are boring to you?      You are doing it right my friend. I've been saying this for a while: be selfish. Being selfish has such a bad connotation but in my opinion it's extremely important. I'm a pretty firm believer that you don't have to do anything you don't want to do, and rightfully so. Do the things that interest YOU, and do them well. Those are the things that will bring happiness to your life.

When I got my 1600X form Micro Center this summer they had a deal for $50 off the  motherboard (instead of the normal $30 off). it's a more expensive board than I would normally buy, but I sprung for it since I got a deal.  I'm not sure what the core count has to do with it.

Comment: I'm really proud of you for stabding up for yourself here! It sounds like she's being incredibly difficult but you've been holding your own.   I think you need to firmly remind your mother that this is YOUR wedding. That if need be, she can take her money and scram because she won't be invited to the wedding if she keeps behaving this way. It may mean you have to postpone, and change your expectations, but it will be YOURS instead of hers.   People often forget that as children we have a lot of power in these relationships. Your mom doesn't want to lose you; you're worth a thousand times more than this wedding. If you firmly tell her that this is going to permanently alter if not ruin your relationship with her, she'll back off. Don't get upset, don't allow her to bring you into a shouting match, just stay firm and keep repeating "Mom, this is going to ruin our relationship if you keep behaving this way.".   Eventually she'll get it, and you'll see a shift, that, or she'll walk away. You do have to be ready for that outcome. Either way you will have taken your life back and you will be making a stand that will create the firm boundaries you'll want in place when you're buying a house, having kids etc.   Be strong OP. This whole thing is hard, and incredibly unfair to you. But it's also an opportunity for you to shape this relationship into something better.   Goodluck!

Downstate contributes the lion's share of tax revenue to NY State. And we receive a lot less back in state expenditures.  If anything, New York City is propping up Western NY.

Comment: I‚Äôll agree with nicue, best to look at a DAC.  Basically there‚Äôs two thing you need to get done here:  1. Convert digital to analog. 2. Get the level right for your use.  How good a sound card is for those two steps depends entirely on the sound card, and it needs to be good at both of the tasks.  Ideally, would be better (more or a safe bet) to go with something dedicated to the job of driving headphones. No matter if that‚Äôs DAC and amp in one, or if they‚Äôre separate units.  Note that the DT770 comes in several different versions, and how much power you need to drive them depends entirely on which version you have.

Comment: &gt;And also are now faced with more challenges, new possibilities, and a greater burden.   Name them.  We have absolutely no idea what state the galaxy is in at the end of the film. I have no idea what Rey's ambitions are now. I know the "good" guys have nothing, I have no clue about the bad guys.   Either we somehow start up a few days after TLJ, or there needs to be a big time jump. Either way, you then need to take time to establish things, and as it's the last film that almost certainly means we're just going to get more set pieces rather than anything slow and contemplative that will build on the characters. It's not going to be satisfying because there's not enough time in one remaining film to cover enough ground.

Comment: There a lot of people in this sub that are frustrated with the Hawks and the way the season has gone. They believe something is wrong with the team, attitude, culture, players, coaching, whatever couch analysis they can make. They're taking their negative, frustrated feelings about the team, and projecting them on to Earl in order to make the case that he wants off the team because he must be unhappy.  And yes, while the way you put it sounds ridiculous, that is kind of how a lot of sports fan are. Like when they say *we won the Super Bowl*, *We've got a chance to make the playoffs*. They watch every game, they get crazy emotional based on the performance and outcomes. They wear the jerseys. They gloat about *their* team.  Think about that.

Comment: Imo he's a great unit but madara is still number 1 when it comes to heart. Although he doesn't have much utility it's a plus that he isn't as crippled as night guy is. It's better that he gets one thing done the best (aoe nuking) with little buffs than nuking and being crippled with immobilization or something. Without dupes he's ok but he's an absolute monster with them especially for people with not many characters of each element. Not to mention he's pretty good for pvp if you give him a support unit to carry him speed wise.

Otherwise, yes, there are literally hundreds of miniature manufacturers out there!  I suggest starting with Age of Sigmar, and if you're looking for something a little more "DnD" check out Otherworld Miniatures as a jumping off point.  "ttfix" is a great blog to follow for non-gw miniature news.

Comment: You live somewhere absurdly cheap, or you're talking about copies you can buy off eBay.  $600 buys you a Berk catback for the S2000, which is a nicely priced unit.  That's about what a cheaper catback for an E36 M3 or E46 non-M will cost you.  Everything goes up from there, like $6-12k Fabspeed exhausts for Porsches.

Romo was a gunslinger that had lost a step he was going to take shots no matter how good a line he had in front of him. Daks taking those shots now the only difference is Dak is ten years younger and a lot sturdier. Romo was my favorite player of all time bit I get why they made the move.

I've had my maxed out K2000 since '97. still works perfectly.  sampling is a must.. ram is easy to max.  get the roms they are worth it.  i use the digital IO all the time to sample from the daw.  also, put a compact flash drive in the HD position.  i have every bank i have ever made on hand inside. Side note,  the K2000 can exist on the termination end of a scsi chain.  so you can have a mac on the other end and have drives in between.  you can directly send samples to the K2000 from sample editor programs that can talk to scsi samplers.

I think it‚Äôs all about how you use it.  To be honest, it‚Äôs not that much different from traditional dating. Sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.   And you always have r/tinder for laughs.  Oh and as far as professionalism, I wonder if that is as big a deal as it used to be?  I mean you‚Äôre just using the available technology to find a date.

I will definitely let you know how it goes haha. Will talk to him tomorrow(!!!)

Give it some personality.                      And have the two monsters not like eachother. Maybe their fighting over your main character. Maybe have them interact with him, and try to get them on their side, in the end turning out that neither one is really on his side, ya know?

(Edit: HE GOT ME A SWITCH AND A HYDRATE SPARK AND A NEW CAR RADIO AND IM FREAKING OUT!!)  It snowed most of the day yesterday, and it was quite a lot. The roads were horrible, causing the party we were supposed to attend to be canceled.   The party I baked 120 cookies for.   So now I have all these cookies and no idea what to do with them. Besides eat them, but I don‚Äôt want to hate myself quite that much. I really dislike the snow and it‚Äôs inopportune appearances.

Comment: I hear your frustration! A super hard part of this journey for me has been finding a 'diet' I believe in, that works, that I can stick to. I don't have a ton of willpower, admittedly.  Check out keto, and keto recipes - you can whip up some amazing, delicious foods, mostly around meats and healthy fats which taste fantastic. Make mistakes, make a mess, but you can totally cook food you love that doesn't hurt your weight loss journey at all. I've learned to make the Dave Ramsey scrambled eggs, bacon (okay, that's super easy, but at least I'm learning!), spicy sausage patties, etc.  Losing weight doesn't have to equal eating bland food. Keto's been a dream for me because I can eat super delicious meats I crave, and don't have to try to turn boneless skinless chicken breasts into something I -want- to eat! :)

Is he really someone you can expect to stand by your side in future through thick and thin?  He should have at the very least visited you on Christmas Eve if he wanted Christmas Day to be family only. Couldn't he bring his brother with him to visit you?

Comment: Who knows?  I think a lot of people watch a movie and then hand out a rating without really thinking about what they just watched.  This is something that applies to almost all media reviews - books, games, TV, movies, whatever.  I think that if you're able to turn your mind off and not notice gaping plot holes, threads that were never actually commented on or explained after their brief (forced?) introduction, etc then Bright is probably a fun movie.  My sister is that kind of moviegoer and loved it - and I'm jealous of her for being able to just turn her mind off and enjoy whatever she's watching like that.  I don't consider that ability to be a bad thing.  I think Bright is probably a fun movie if you're able to do that (look at how many "normal viewer" ratings are in the 8+ range, such as the poll here on Reddit), but becomes worse and worse the more you pay attention to it or try to analyze it.  I couldn't stop noticing how almost every single action in the combat sequences were cuts, for example - it was almost to the point of "one punch, one cut."  And, again, I like Shadowrun a lot so it's kind of like "this is a neat concept but Shadowrun does it better."

Comment: With bitcoin, you are your own full node. You need to be, it is not an option.  Each wallet has a copy of the entire blockchain, and it is mandatory.  In IOTA, if you want access to the network you use a public node. If that public node doesn't work, then you would regress back to the bitcoin model of requiring a full node.  What is the incentive of bitcoin wallets to be full nodes? There is none, it is mandatory from a technical aspect.

Comment: Bodily autonomy. No way and no how should one individual be able to dictate to another whether or not to obtain an invasive and potentially traumatizing medical procedure. It's not silly, it's humane.  And since it takes two to get the process going, once a baby is born, there is equal responsibility to provide what it requires for a quality life. It's not silly, it's good for society.  There is nothing that's going to convince you you're wrong and nothing that's gonna convince me you're right, so I'm just glad the current state of things aligns with my views.

If you have any issues with OEM versions or whatever, the call option to Microsoft usually sorts it out. As for the temps, for idle you're probably looking at a few, say ten degrees or so, above ambient.

Comment: Bcash offers nothing in terms of tech over bitcoin. This is a huge problem with the crypto space, as far as coins and transactions go. Many block chains claim to be much better than bitcoin or etherium, while they are just forks of the same tech. There are certain teams and chains that I believe will make improvements and can make a difference, but the reality is that many of them can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt.  The fact that the only difference between bitcoin and bcash is block size is concerning. This does nothing to help move forward the industry and is imo just a cash grab.

Comment: For a 40/40 Str/Dex build (commonly called a Quality build) you really can't go wrong with most Straight Swords. The Broadsword is good, as is the Longsword, Lothric Knight Sword, Gotthard Twinswords or Irithyll Straight Sword. Aside from that, most Greatswords perform well, as do most Maces/Axes. The beauty of a Quality build is the fact you can get good damage out of almost anything, and have the stats to use pretty much everything as well

Comment: You didn't forget that, you never saw it because it didn't happen.   Most of the Rebel fleet jumps before Vader's Star Destroyer arrives. Only a single ship rams into it, and it explodes.

Comment: It‚Äôs a of money, but photography equipment quickly gets very expensive. Forgetting the ‚Äúastro‚Äù in astrophotography for a moment and just looking at regular photography good quality lenses are easily $1000 and can quickly get up in to the several thousand dollar range (I.e. $6k for a 300mm f/2.8) So $1500 is just scratching the surface in photography.

Comment: In Norway we are willing to take in refugees however we are very stict in how many and who gets to come here. So the best way too describe our situation is that we are willing to let them come here but we are stict on how many. This can be seen with our third biggest party view on immigration. Our prime minister also said she is willing too break the international law about immigration If the problems in Sweden keep rising. So in summary we are very strict about it compared to Sweden, Germany, France and you get the point. My personal oppinion about refugees is that they can stay here as long they work and integrate to our culture and sociaty. Ofcourse Norway is also an small nation so there is limits on how many we can take.

Comment: The Hellsing perk Dark Binding is the one that lets you eat souls, but it just generically makes you more powerful. Doesnt allow you to specifically take abilities from people.  Rogue's Power Absortion power from XMen Evolution is temporary, and also has the drawback of personality fuckery.  Bleach's Hollows don't have a skill steal power. The only thing that comes close is body possession, but you can only take one body at a time.

Comment: Automaton is most effective on the sorc, and less so on others due to the amount of physical damage in the sorc's kit. Sunderflame is most effective on the dk, but can be used on other chars too. Other than that, mix and match for the group you are in.

Comment: [Latest Biggs article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-browns-10-thoughts-brad-biggs-20171225-story.html)  &gt;It‚Äôs going to be fascinating to see how things play out. Some have suggested to me that there‚Äôs no way in heck Fuller will be back with the Bears.  But he also says:  &gt;Others have suggested that a big stack of money can make anyone feel a whole lot better about anything that transpired previously and when you consider the starter opposite Fuller ‚Äì Prince Amukamara ‚Äì is also scheduled to become a free agent, the Bears could help themselves out by re-signing one of them.  Basically, he‚Äôs heard things but stops short of fully buying into what his sources tell him.    As for Leming, he‚Äôs been wrong enough times that he shouldn‚Äôt be considered a credible source.  Fuller wanting out could turn out to be true, though.
